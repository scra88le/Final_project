## Information Theory (IT) covariates 

GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002â€“10 and 2011-19. They included 5 IT predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:tableGamParamsIT). A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods.

### Histograms of Information theory covariates

Histograms of IT covariates using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, across all of Shetland are shown in figure \@ref(fig:itHisto). The *marginal entropy* for the Shetland landscape is approximately normally distributed, indicating that habitat within the Shetland landscape is spatially diverse but that very low and highly diverse habitat within Shetland are relatively rare. The mode of the *conditional entropy* is relatively low with a distribution that shows significant positive skew; this suggests that the Shetland landscape has relatively low geometric intricacy. This arises when cells of one category within a landscape raster are predominantly adjacent to cells of the same category. The overall spatio-thematic complexity is measured by *joint entropy*. This can be thought of as quantifying the uncertainty in determining the habitat type of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. For Shetland, joint entropy appears to be approximately normally distributed. This indicates that habitat with very high or low spatio-thematic complexity is relatively rare on Shetland. Due to the spatial autocorrelation, the value of *mutual information* tends to grow with a diversity of the landscape (marginal entropy). To adjust this tendency, it is possible to calculate *relative mutual information* by dividing the mutual information by the marginal entropy. Relative mutual information always has a range between 0 and 1, and quantifies the degree of aggregation of spatial habitat. It can be seen that for Shetland, relative mutual information is distributed with significant negative skew. This implies that habitat types across Shetland are predominantly aggregated - small relatively information values indicate significant fragmentation in landscape habitat patterns.

### Histograms of Information Theory covariates for surveyed squares only

1km squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS were used to generate IT covariates histograms using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:itSBBSHisto). Here we can see that the *conditional entropy* and the *marginal entropy* across all surveyed squares had a mode that was significantly higher than the Shetland wide values shown in Figure \@ref(fig:itHisto). There is also significantly less negative negative skew in the *relative mutual information* of the surveyed squares.

### Population change model against IT covarirates

By using the response of the 2002-2010 wader densities as the offset for the 2011-19 densities, a third series of GAMs were fitted to show the ratio of population change in response to environmental covariates. This is summarised in Figure \@ref(fig:itHeatMapPopChg). It can be seen that there are no statistically significant results for Redshank or Snipe, or for marginal entropy as a covariate.
