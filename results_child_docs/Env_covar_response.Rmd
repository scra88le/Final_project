## Environmental covariate response

GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002â€“10 and 2011-19. They included 10 environmental predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:tableGamParamsAbundance). A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods.

### Environmental covariate GAM model parameters

Table \@ref(tab:tableGamParamsAbundance) shows the GAM model parameters for the model fits for the two periods where abundance response (density) was modelled, and the associated plots showing breeding wader density against each environmental covariate are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:responsePlots). The statistically significant correlations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate are summarised for each species in heatmaps; Figure \@ref(fig:heatMap200210) for 2002-10 and Figure \@ref(fig:heatMap201119) for 2011-2019. 

```{r heatMap200210, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2010 inclusive'}
covar_species_assoc_2002_10 <- data.frame(
  Covariate = c('Elevation (m)',
          'Bog % cover', 
          'Grassland % cover', 
          'Heathland % cover', 
          'pH', 
          'Topsoil Organic Carbon %', 
          'Available Water Capacity (kPA)',
          'Distance to sea (m)', 
          'Bare peat % cover', 
          'Improved grassland % cover'),
  CU = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","NS","NS","Neg","Neg","Pos","Neg","Pos"),
  L =  c("Neg","Neg","Pos","NS","NS","Neg","Neg","Neg","NS","NS"),
  OC = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","Pos","NS","Neg","Neg","Pos","NS","NS"),
  RK = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","NS","NS","Neg","Neg","NS","Neg","Pos"),
  SN = c("NS", "NS","Pos","Pos","Pos","Neg","NS","Pos","Neg","Neg")
  )%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = CU:SN, names_to = "Species", values_to ="Association")

covar_species_assoc_2002_10 %>%

  geom_tile(colour="white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "grey", "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

For the 2002-10 survey period in Figure \@ref(fig:heatMap200210), it can be seen that pH is only statistically significant for one species (Snipe), whilst topsoil organic carbon and grassland are oppositely correlated. Distance to sea is perhaps the most interesting covariate in that Lapwing show greater density at the coast whilst Curlew, Oystercatcher and Snipe show greater densities inland. 

```{r heatMap201119, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive'}
covar_species_assoc_2011_19 <- data.frame(
  Covariate = c('Elevation (m)',
                'Bog % cover', 
                'Grassland % cover', 
                'Heathland % cover', 
                'pH', 
                'Topsoil Organic Carbon %', 
                'Available Water Capacity (kPA)',
                'Distance to sea (m)', 
                'Bare peat % cover', 
                'Improved grassland % cover'),
  
  CU = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","Pos","Pos","Neg","Neg","Pos","Neg","Pos"),
  L =  c("Neg","Neg","Pos","Pos","NS","Neg","Neg","Neg","Neg","Pos"),
  OC = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","Pos","Pos","Neg","Neg","Neg","Neg","Pos"),
  RK = c("Neg","Neg","Pos","Pos","NS","Neg","Neg","NS","Neg","Pos"),
  SN = c("NS", "Neg","Pos","Pos","NS","NS","Pos","Pos","Neg","Neg")
  )%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = CU:SN, names_to = "Species", values_to ="Association")

covar_species_assoc_2011_19 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Covariate, fill = Association)) +
  geom_tile(colour="white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "red","grey")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:heatMap201119) we can see that there are fewer associations that are not statistically significant. For Curlew it is seen that all covariate associations are now statistically significant (versus 2002-2010 where pH and Heathland cover were not significant). Oystercatcher also have all covariates with statistically significant associations, but for the later survey period the distance to association is now negative with increase distance. Lapwing only have one covariate, pH, that is not statistically significant. For Redshank the main change in the later survey period is that Heathland percentage cover is now statistically significant, and has a positive association. Snipe now have a positive association with available water capacity and a negative association with percentage bog cover.

## Population change model against environmental covariates

By using the response of the 2002-2010 wader densities as the offset for the 2011-19 densities, a third series of GAMs were fitted to show the ratio of population change in response to environmental covariates. This is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:heatMapPopChg).

```{r heatMapPopChg, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Summary of population change ratio associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2019 inclusive'}

  Covariate = c('Elevation (m)',
                'Bog % cover',

                'Heathland % cover', 
                'pH', 
                'Topsoil Organic Carbon %', 
                'Available Water Capacity (kPA)',
                'Distance to sea (m)', 
                'Bare peat % cover', 
                'Improved grassland % cover'),
  
  CU = c("Neg","Neg","NS","Pos","NS","NS","NS","Neg","NS","NS"),
  L =  c("NS","NS","NS","Pos","Pos","Neg","Neg","NS","NS","Pos"),
  OC = c("NS","NS","NS","NS","Pos","NS","Pos","Neg","NS","Pos"),
  RK = c("Pos","Pos","Neg","Pos","NS","NS","Pos","NS","NS","NS"),
  SN = c("NS", "NS","NS","NS","Neg","Pos","Pos","NS","NS","NS")
  )%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = CU:SN, names_to = "Species", values_to ="Association")

pop_chg_2002_19 %>%

  geom_tile(colour="white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue","grey","red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:heatMapPopChg) suggests that the environmental covariates with that have had the most positive associations with breeding wader density are heathland percentage cover and available water capacity, whilst the percentage of bare peatland has had no statistical significance, followed by the percentage grassland cover that has only one negative association with the population change ratio of Redshank.

The model parameters and associated plots for population change ratio modelling are shown in Figures \@ref(popChgPlots) and Table \@ref(tab:tableGamParamsPopChg) respectively.
