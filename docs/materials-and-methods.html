<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Breeding wader survey data</h2>
<p>Two independent sets of survey data were used to provide spatial abundance for breeding waders. The Shetland Breeding Bird Survey (SBBS) is a citizen science project that is overseen by the Shetland Biological Records Centre. The SBBS is an annual survey undertaken since 2002, whereby local volunteers select a 1km Ordnance Survey 1km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> to survey. It is important to note that to encourage volunteer uptake, these squares are not randomly allocated in space; typically the location of the survey is selected by the volunteer. There are 3992 1km squares that cover the Shetland archipelago; excluding Fair Isle and Foula. Volunteers walk either a 2km transect around their chosen square, or two 1km transects that bisect the square. All breeding bird species observed 100m either side of the transect are recorded. All transects were walked twice, typically April to mid-May and mid-May to late June. All surveys were undertaken before 9am and in good weather (wind force four or less, and dry). The annual abundance recorded for each breeding species within a given square is the maximum of count from the two visits. Upto 2019 there have been 139 different OS 1km squares surveyed as part of the SBBS. Although the survey runs every year, not all 139 survey squares have been covered annually. Since 2002, new squares have been introduced over the years, some are no longer covered, and there are some gaps when volunteers have been unable to carry out surveys.</p>
<p>The RSPB have undertaken annual field based surveys across a number of well-known Shetland breeding wader sites since 1987 <span class="citation">(Campbell and Ellis <a href="#ref-Campbell1" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. The initial survey covered 33,000 ha or 293 sites of <em>inbye</em> land; this is land that is lowland rough grassland, and is typically not farmed intensively. From the 1987 survey, 6900 ha or 122 sites were identified. The survey data used in this study was recorded between 2013 and 2018 and are taken from up-to 29 sites, a subset of the original 1987 sites. The survey method <span class="citation">(O’Brien and Murray <a href="#ref-OBrien1998-iy" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> required observers to walk to within 100m of every part of the survey site and to complete their survey between dawn and 12:00 hours. Three visits were made, one in each of the periods 15 April-30 April, 1 May-21 May and 22 May-18 June. Successive visits were separated by at least a week. Cold, wet or windy weather conditions were avoided. Each wader observed was recorded against a specific field. The method for calculating the breeding wader abundance recorded was species specific: Lapwing, Oystercatcher and Redshank abundance was recorded as the total numbers of birds seen in each field; Snipe—the number of drumming plus chipping birds in each field; for Curlew the mean count of individual Curlew (MNI) over three standard survey visits to each site was calculated, and the numbers of nesting pairs was calculated as 0.71 MNI + 0.10 <span class="citation">(Grant et al. <a href="#ref-Grant2000-ns" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Estimating detectability</h2>
<p>The two surveys in question assumed perfect detectability of the survey species. Due to the imprecise nature of field surveys this could result in a bias in species detectability, which could further result in inaccurate population estimates. To account for this bias, there are a number of sophisticated statistical techniques such as <em>distance sampling</em> that account for this, in order to reduce the standard error associated with a population estimate <span class="citation">(Newson et al. <a href="#ref-Newson2008-oq" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Such techniques typically require more structured survey techniques such as precisely measuring the distance and angle, between the target and the transect line. Unfortunately this data was not available for the two survey datasets used within the study. Inorder to generate a probabiliy of detection, and therefore account for detectability bias, the r-package <code>unmarked</code> <span class="citation">(Fiske and Chandler <a href="#ref-Fiske2011-xf" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> was used to generate a probability of detection for each species. Unmarked adopts a generative modelling process whereby observations are modelled through a combination of (1) a state process determining abundance at each site and (2) a detection process that yields observations conditional on the state process. Probability of detection (detectability) was modelled using <code>unmarked</code> for each species by using count data across multiple sites within and years, using day of year as a covariate. An average was then taken across years to give an average detectability for each species.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> EUNIS habitat classification</h3>
<p>The EUNIS habitat classification is a European wide system for habitat classification <span class="citation">(“EUNIS” <a href="#ref-noauthor_2014-bw" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. For the purposes of EUNIS, a ‘habitat’ is defined as:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Each habitat type is identified by specific codes and a description. The classification of terrestrial habitat is hierarchical and comprises three levels. For the purpose of this study the level 1 classification was used so as not to overdisperse the response variable (breeding wader abundnace). The EUNIS dataset is available as a categorical GeoTiff file, at a resolution of 10x10m.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> Improved grassland</h3>
<p>Across Shetland crofters have <em>improved</em> parcels of low-lying grassland in-order to take an annual crop of haylage or silage. It is typically used as fodder for sheep and cattle during the long winter season. This habitat is an important environmental covariate for studying breeding waders, as it has been suggested that improved grasslands are an important feeding habitat for nesting waders and their chicks <span class="citation">(McCallum et al. <a href="#ref-McCallum2018-gx" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Improved grassland is not a specific category within the EUNIS habitat classification, rather it is included within Grasslands class (E), which also covers unimproved and rough grasslands. Consequently remotely sensed satellite image data were used together with supervised machine learning techniques <span class="citation">(Abdi <a href="#ref-Abdi2020-aa" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> to generate a spatial classification for Shetland improved grassland.</p>
<p>A Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Shetland archipelago, comprising 11 different spectral bands <span class="citation">(“Sentinel-2” <a href="#ref-sentinel-ovr" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> , was used to produce an improved grassland raster layer. This was achieved by using the <code>r</code> programming language <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-lang" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> to train both a support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used in conjunction with the <code>tidymodels</code> package <span class="citation">(Kuhn and Wickham <a href="#ref-tidymodels" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> to classify each raster cell, according to the spectral band values within it. Training datasets comprising polygons were created across five different habitat classes: improved grassland, unimproved grassland, upland, bare peat and crops. 1000 spatial samples were randomly drawn from each class training dataset; a sample comprising a value for each of the 11 spectral bands, for the specific sample location. The aggregate training dataset , comprising 5000 samples, was then split into training and testing data. The training data was subsequently resampled using 5-Fold cross-validation in order to reduce variability of the model classification. The hyperparameters of a radial basis SVM were tuned and the best model was selected based on an accuracy metric validated against the test data split. The model fit was then used to make a prediction for improved grassland over the entire Shetland archipelago.</p>

Location coordinates of survey squares were converted to planar OSGB36 national Grid coordinates as normalized easting and northing (in meters). Spatial variability in wader abundance was modelled as a spatial smooth, with the number of knots constrained (k = 20) and environmental covariates included as a parametric term.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Habitat spatial complexity response</h2>
<p>In order to investigate an association between breeding wader abundance and the complexity of habitat spatial patterns within the landscape, metrics using information theory (IT) <span class="citation">(Nowosad and Stepinski <a href="#ref-Nowosad2019-bo" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> were applied to quantify habitat pattern complexity of all SBBS squares across Shetland.

<p>The <code>r</code> package <code>landscapemetrics</code> <span class="citation">(Hesselbarth et al. <a href="#ref-landscapemetrics" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> was used to generate all IT metrics, using the EUNIS habitat raster for Shetland as a spatially distributed categorisation of landscape habitat. A description of the different metrics incorporated in the analysis is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Marginal Entropy, H(X)</em> - measures the compositional diversity of habitats in space; from mono-thematic patterns (lower H(X)) to multi-thematic patterns (large (H(X)). So landscapes with one dominating habitat (for example, peatland on the Shetland island of Yell) have a relatively low H(X), whilst landscapes with multiple different types of habitat that are evenly distributed (such as a village with a patch work of gardens, housing and undeveloped land) have a relatively high H(X). This can be seen in Figure <a href="materials-and-methods.html#fig:marginalEntropy">2.1</a>, with H(X) shown above each landscape sample.</li>

</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><em>Conditional Entropy, H(Y|X)</em> - quantifies the geometric intricacy of a spatial pattern within a landscape. If habitat type A is predominantly adjacent to habitat type B, H(Y|X) will be relatively low. Conversely if habitat type A is adjacent to many different habitat categories, then H(Y|X) will be relatively high. Figure <a href="materials-and-methods.html#fig:condEntropy">2.2</a> gives some examples of this.</li>

</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><em>Joint Entropy, H(X,Y)</em> - this provides a measure of the uncertainty in determining the habitat category of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. So landscapes with high H(X,Y) are typically spatially complex with many different habitat types. Note that joint entropy is not capable of distinguishing between patterns that have high spatial aggregation. The variation can be seen in Figure <a href="materials-and-methods.html#fig:jointEntropy">2.3</a> .</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Relative mutual information, U</em> - quantifies the degree of aggregation (clumpliness) of spatial habitat categories from fragmented patterns (lower U) to consolidated patterns (higher U). A landscape comprising a loch within a forest would have a relatively high U, whilst a landscape comprising many different crop types spread across many small fields would have low U.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Wader population abundance modelling</h2>
<p>Given the set of environmental covariates for each SBBS 1km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> square and the associated SBBS count data, a machine learning approach using <code>r</code>and the <code>tidymodels</code> <span class="citation">(Kuhn and Wickham <a href="#ref-tidymodels" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> package was taken to fit a regression model. The resulting model enabled an annual population to be generated for each breeding wader species across all of Shetland, from the 2002 to 2019, as a function of environmental covariates. In order to fit the model the count data for each species were adjusted according to their mean detectability. All count data for a given SBBS 1km square was joined with the associated environmental covariate data. The joined data were thens plit such that 70% was allocated to model training and 30% to model testing. The training data were then processed so that covariates that have 80% absolute correlations with other covariates are removed; this ensures that possible adverse outcomes due to co-linearity are minimised <span class="citation">(Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick <a href="#ref-Zuur2010-kp" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. The covariate data within the training dataset were then normalised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. An extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) algorithm was used to fit a regression model using a poisson distribution. 10-fold cross validation was used to resample the data in order to ensure any bias in SBBS survey squares was minimised. Hyperparameters used to fit the xgboost model were selected using a grid containing 20 random variations for each hyperparameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>min_n</code> - the minimum number of data points in a node that are required for the node to be split further)</li>
<li><code>trees</code> - the number of trees contained in the ensemble</li>
<li><code>mtry</code> - the number of predictors (covariates) that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree models.</li>
</ul>
<p>A model was fit for each hyperparameter combination and for each species; giving 200 different models. The best model fit for each each species was selected according to the lowest root mean squared error (rmse). The hyperparamters associated with each best fit were then used to further tune the model for a final fit. The rmse for the final fit was then evaluated against the test dataset, for each species. Finally, to generate an annual population account across all over Shetland for each species, the final model fit was used across all SBBS 1km squares (n=?). This gave a mean estimate for abundance for each square, plus a lower and upper confidence interval. Summing up these values across all squares, for each species by year, gave an overall population estimate across Shetland for the years 2002 to 2019.</p>

The net change between the two periods was also plotted so as to visualise the areas of Shetland that have seen a net increase or decrease in species abundance between 2002 and 2019.</p>
