It seems that there has been ongoing surveying effort in the south and central mainland and on the islands of Unst, Bressay and Noss, but less coverage elsewhere. Figure 2.1: Number of years a SBBS 1km square was survyered (n) between 2002 and 2019 2.1.2 Outliers The Cleveland dot plot (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010) is a chart in which the row number of an observation is plotted versus the observation variable, thereby providing a more detailed view of individual observations than a boxplot. Points that stick out on the right-hand side, or on the left-hand side, are observed values that are considerably larger, or smaller, than the majority of the observations. Figure 2.2 appears to show that there are no major outliers across all species, but that there are many counts equal to zero indicating that the data might be zero-inflated. Figure 2.2: Cleveland dot plot of species counts in Shetland BBS data from 2002 to 2018 2.1.3 Testing for normality A large number of statistical regression techniques assume normality. Visualising the SBBS count data as a histogram can help assess if it is normally distributed. This is shown in the plot in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Histogram of SBBS count data across all years, by species Inorder to validate the outcome of the plots in Figure 2.3 a significance test was undertaken and the results are shown in Table ??. Species W p-value OC 0.8628058 0 L 0.7546102 0 CU 0.8327195 0 RK 0.6995970 0 SN 0.8000661 0 The p-value for each species in ?? is &lt;&lt; 0.05. This suggests that the count data for all species are significantly different from the normal distribution. 2.1.4 Poisson distribution and zero inflation The histograms of species counts in Figure 2.3 suggest that count data is poisson distribution. Also there are a significant number of zeros in the count data, for all species. This suggests that the zero-inflation poisson distribution describes the data. Table ?? below shows the results of a significance test (Broek 1995) for zero inflation in a poisson distribution. Species Expected zeros Zeros observed Chi squared p-value CU 223.9173 433 384.2445 0 L 323.5230 585 547.5071 0 OC 119.1142 309 446.9641 0 RK 520.3458 694 271.6801 0 SN 134.4406 359 577.9990 0 All results have a significant statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) and therefore the count distribution across species is assumed to be a zero-inflated poisson process. The statistical modelling methods used on the data must support a poisson distribution and zero inflation where possible. 2.1.5 Homogeniety of variance Homogeneity of variance within the data is an important assumption in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other regression-related models. The series of boxplots in Figure 2.4 show how counts across all surveyed BBS squares vary across years 2002 to 2018, for each breeding wader species. Figure 2.4: Box plot showing variance of counts across all surveyed Shetland BBS squares and all years, by species To test the homogeneity of variance of species counts between years, for each species, we can apply the Fligner-Killeen test. This is used as the count data are shown to be non-normal. Table 2.1 shows the results of the test applied to the Shetland BBS data. For p-values &gt; 0.05 the data variance are homogeneous. Table 2.1: Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variance for Shetland SBBS species counts, across all years Species Chi-squared p-value df OC 18.11614 0.3171401 16 L 29.11514 0.0231712 16 CU 18.36325 0.3030590 16 RK 26.72879 0.0445979 16 SN 47.40824 0.0000588 16 Lapwing, Redshank and Snipe variances are heterogeneous according to the test results in Table 2.1. The solution to heterogeneity of variance is to transform the response variable to stabilize the variance year-on-year, or applying statistical regression techniques that do not require homogeneity. 2.1.6 Status of surveys between 2002 and 2019 Before any detailed statistical modelling was undertaken a simple analysis into how the population changed in each surveyed 1km square between 2002-2011 and 2012-2019. The 1 km squares shown (n=139) were those surveyed in both periods and where farmland waders colonized, increased, remained stable, declined or went extinct. This gave an initial view as to potential population trends between the two stated periods. Figure 2.5 shows the state changes between the two analysis periods. Figure 2.5: Population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 Figure 2.6 below shows an aggregation of certain categories; whereby extinct and decreased are grouped, and colonised and increased are grouped. Figure 2.6: Aggregate population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 2.1.7 Survey Bootstrap Shetland BBS volunteers were able to choose which squares they surveyed. The survey squares are therefore not randomly allocated across the Shetland archipelago. As a result of this non-randomised allocation there could be potential bias in the habitat types surveyed; for example, in-bye is closer to roads and housing than upland habitats. To test this a bootstrap of percentage cover of EUNIS habitat categories D, E and F (see ??) across all OS 1km squares was undertaken, and then compared to a bootstrap of the same data, but only those OS squares surveyed by volunteers as part of the Shetland BBS. Figure 2.7: Mean % cover per 1km\\(^2\\) of EUNIS habitat types D, E and F, bootstrap sample of OSGB squares v boostrap of surveyed squares. R=1000 This shows that grassland and heathland are significantly oversampled within the Shetland BBS surveys. 2.2 Detectability todo - using unmarked script. 2.3 Environmental covariate analysis Each of the covariates described in {#environmental-covariates} was generated for each Shetland BBS squares (n=3992). 2.3.1 Histogram of environmental covariates Figure 2.8 shows histograms of for these covariates for data taken across all Shetland OS GB 1km squares. It can be seen that bog type habitat predominates across Shetland, and that majority of the landscape is at less than 100m elevation. The mode for the pH is around 4, which is typical for acidic peatland. Figure 2.8: Histograms of environmental covariates across all of Shetland 2.3.2 Histogram of environmental covariates for Shetland BBS squares only This can be contrasted with covariate histograms for only those OS squares (n=139) that were surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS, as seen in Figure 2.9. It seems across all nesting wader species, there is a preference for wet but not water-logged habitat as seen in the AWC histogram. Also, the majority of breeding waders appear to nest within 1km of the coast. It appears that breeding waders also have a preference for grassland (both improved and unimproved) presents the majority of the habitat cover, over heathland. Figure 2.9: Histograms of environmental covariates across only those squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS 2.3.3 Density plots Density plots of all environmental covariates across Shetland BBS squares (n=139) are shown in Figure 2.10. These figures provide an overlay to the histogramsin {#histogram-of-environmental-covariates-for-shetland-bbs-squares-only}, and represent a smoothed version of a histogram to show the probability density function of the variable. Some distributions are highly skewed, such as distance to sea and elevation. Whilst other covariates like topsoil organic carbon and bog cover are largely a uniformly distributed. None of the covariates appear to be normally distributed. Figure 2.10: Density plots of environmental covariates against breeding wader count data 2.4 Environmental covariate response GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002–10 and 2011-19. They included 10 environmental predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 2.4.1 Environmental covariate GAM model parameters Table ?? shows the GAM model parameters for the model fits for the two periods where abundance response (density) was modelled, and the associated plots showing breeding wader density against each environmental covariate are shown in Figure ??. The statistically significant correlations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate are summarised for each species in heatmaps; Figure 2.11 for 2002-10 and Figure 2.12 for 2011-2019. Figure 2.11: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2010 inclusive For the 2002-10 survey period in Figure 2.11, it can be seen that pH is only statistically significant for one species (Snipe), whilst topsoil organic carbon and grassland are oppositely correlated. Distance to sea is perhaps the most interesting covariate in that Lapwing show greater density at the coast whilst Curlew, Oystercatcher and Snipe show greater densities inland. Figure 2.12: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive In Figure 2.12 we can see that there are fewer associations that are not statistically significant. For Curlew it is seen that all covariate associations are now statistically significant (versus 2002-2010 where pH and Heathland cover were not significant). Oystercatcher also have all covariates with statistically significant associations, but for the later survey period the distance to association is now negative with increase distance. Lapwing only have one covariate, pH, that is not statistically significant. For Redshank the main change in the later survey period is that Heathland percentage cover is now statistically significant, and has a positive association. Snipe now have a positive association with available water capacity and a negative association with percentage bog cover.

of the 2002-2010 wader densities as the offset for the 2011-19 densities, a third series of GAMs were fitted to show the ratio of population change in response to environmental covariates. This is shown in Figure 2.23. Figure 2.23: Summary of population change ratio associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2019 inclusive Figure 2.23 suggests that the environmental covariates with that have had the most positive associations with breeding wader density are heathland percentage cover and available water capacity, whilst the percentage of bare peatland has had no statistical significance, followed by the percentage grassland cover that has only one negative association with the population change ratio of Redshank. The model parameters and associated plots for population change ratio modelling are shown in Figures ?? and Table ?? respectively.

They included 5 IT predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 2.6.1 Histograms of Information theory covariates Histograms of IT covariates using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, across all of Shetland are shown in figure 2.29. The marginal entropy for the Shetland landscape is approximately normally distributed, indicating that habitat within the Shetland landscape is spatially diverse but that very low and highly diverse habitat within Shetland are relatively rare. The mode of the conditional entropy is relatively low with a distribution that shows significant positive skew; this suggests that the Shetland landscape has relatively low geometric intricacy. This arises when cells of one category within a landscape raster are predominantly adjacent to cells of the same category. The overall spatio-thematic complexity is measured by joint entropy. This can be thought of as quantifying the uncertainty in determining the habitat type of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. For Shetland, joint entropy appears to be approximately normally distributed. This indicates that habitat with very high or low spatio-thematic complexity is relatively rare on Shetland. Due to the spatial autocorrelation, the value of mutual information tends to grow with a diversity of the landscape (marginal entropy). To adjust this tendency, it is possible to calculate relative mutual information by dividing the mutual information by the marginal entropy. Relative mutual information always has a range between 0 and 1, and quantifies the degree of aggregation of spatial habitat. It can be seen that for Shetland, relative mutual information is distributed with significant negative skew. This implies that habitat types across Shetland are predominantly aggregated - small relatively information values indicate significant fragmentation in landscape habitat patterns. Figure 2.29: Histograms of Information Theory covariates across all Shetland OS 1km squares 2.6.2 Histograms of Information Theory covariates for surveyed squares only 1km squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS were used to generate IT covariates histograms using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, as shown in Figure 2.30. Here we can see that the conditional entropy and the marginal entropy across all surveyed squares had a mode that was significantly higher than the Shetland wide values shown in Figure 2.29. There is also significantly less negative negative skew in the relative mutual information of the surveyed squares.
