This nesting strategy means that the wader continuously surveils their environment for predators, immediately taking flight if an attacker enters the vicinity of the nest, and relying on the fact that eggs within the nest are cryptically marked so as to avoid detection. Groups of Oystercatcher and Lapwing can often form aerial displays in-order to ambush and deter any attackers [ref]. Most wader species exist near water and feed on invertebrates or small crustaceans by probing in mud and soil, or picking items off rocky shores in both coastal and freshwater habitats. This feeding behaviour is facilitated by the use of slender and often long bills that can be used for probing, together with relatively long legs to allow wading in shallow water when feeding. Euraisian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus - primarily lives at the coast, where it also breeds and feeds on bivalves and gastropods. Has over the last 50 years started to breed in-land on farmland, where it’s primary food source is earthworms and insect larvae. Oystercatcher have strong mate and site fidelity, where a single nesting attempt is made per breeding season. They typically lay their eggs in April and unlike other farmland waders, they will sometimes nest close to man made habitat such as buildings or on top of drystone walls. Nesting on flat gravel roofs was first noted in Aberdeen in the 1960s, with these birds often feeding in urban parks and on lawns. Unlike other waders, adults can take food to their young rather than requiring the young to move to areas where they can feed themselves; a feature which enables rooftop nesting. Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus - outside of the breeding season, they may overwinter in large flocks in-land as far south as northern Africa. Lapwing feed on insects and earthworms, and have a preference for feeding at night in order to avoid predators. As the Lapwing has a short bill, they can only forage for food near the surface of the soil. They will therefore typically nest in areas that are invertebrate rich. Lapwing often form loose colonies when nesting, that can together drive away predators. Their chicks typically hatch in early May, with replacement clutches typically in June if the first hatch failed. Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata - Scotland’s largest wader generally spend their winters near the coast and return to their Shetland breeding territories to hatch their chicks in early June. This later breeding period than Oystercatchers and Lapwings is associated with a requirement for the nest to be in tall vegetation (c.15cm tall or more). The Curlew can be migratory, often over wintering in Africa or Southern Europe. Though in the milder climate of Scotland it can be resident all year round. Common Redshank Tringa totanus - perhaps the least common of the farmland waders. They spend the winter at the coast, particularly on mudflats and estuaries and nest most abundantly on wetland, espeically coastal saltmarsh and machair. Pools of shallow standing water are particularly attractive to nesting Redshank, as they feed on the small invertebrates that they support. Their chicks hatch in late May. They are a migratory species, over wintering on Atlantic coasts south of Ireland and Great Britain. Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago - Snipe nest in dense cover of rushes and sedges within wetland habitats, as well as in wet scrapes and bogs in moorland habitats. They feed on invertabrates in areas of shallow standing water. They reside in farmland wetlands throughout the year. Snipe are often difficult to observe and often are only detectable by listening out for the drumming that results from their display flights. 1.2 The Shetland archipelago Shetland is a subarctic archipelago located in the North Atlantic between Scotland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The total area of the islands are some 1,466 km\\(^2\\) and they experience an oceanic temperate maritime climate.Due to the relatively harsh climate, short growing season and poor soil quality, Shetland has relatively low agricultural intensification when compared to the rest of the UK. The traditional crofting approach to farming has created farmland characterised by a mosaic of low intensity cropping and grazing. These factors have helped to create a hotspot for farmland breeding waders. The most recent estimates of the Shetland breeding population are from surveys carried out in the late 1990s: 2,300 pairs of Curlew, 1,740 pairs of Lapwing, 3,350 pairs of Oystercatcher, 1,170 pairs of Redshank and 3,450 pairs of Snipe (Harvey et al. 2004) 1.3 Breeding wader abundance response to habitat types The suitability of farmland habitat for breeding waders is likely to be influenced by the historic conversion from more heterogeneous semi-natural grassland to agriculturally improved grassland through soil drainage, liming, fertilization and re-seeding. These practices can result in a structurally uniform sward with reduced invertebrate and earthworm density (Baines 1988, Vickery et al. 2001), though fertilization and liming may increase the availability of some soil invertebrates (McCallum et al. 2015). Enclosed improved grassland can provide nesting sites (O’Brien 2004), but also foraging sites for birds breeding on nearby unenclosed moorland (Robson 1998), particularly if fields have high densities of soil invertebrates. (Franks et al. 2017) looked at how environmental covariates affected breeding Curlew. A key requirement for breeding waders on farmland is the type of habitat and sward height. Table ?? below summarises typical habitat and sward height that the farmland waders discussed above, typically select for their nesting site. #waderPrefs Habitat Preferences for Breeding Waders. Wader Breeding habitat Sward height Breeding season Oystercatcher Grassland or arable fields Short April - July Lapwing Grassland, spring crops, fallow land Bare/short April - late July Curlew Heathland, grassland and bog Long May - late July Redshank Wet grassland, wet scrapes Long May - late July Snipe Wetland, standing water Long ? With regards to the categorisation of sward height: bare - ploughed land with no emergent vegetation. This is typical of spring sowed crops short - managed (improved) grassland for grazing, or for mowing to make hayage or silage. Sward is typically less than 5cm tall. long - unimproved grassland, fallow pasture, heathland, marsh or wetland. Sward is typically 15cm or more. 1.4 Breeding wader abundance response to landscape composition and scale The size and composition of a landscape is key to sustaining a long term population of a bird species, especially one that has experienced a recent decline (Macdonald 2019). If a suitable landscape exists at the necessary scale, it will provide security against localised adverse effects such as starvation, predation, inbreeding and bad weather. This in-turn will allow populations, whose number is above a certain threshold, to survive major short-term fluctuations, in abundance (Melbourne and Hastings 2008). Understanding how abundance of breeding waders respond to the scale and composition of suitable habitat could be a major factor in helping to conserve them. 1.5 The importance of agriculture to breeding waders Agriculture is generally thought to depress biodiversity but in some cases it can be beneficial, especially low-intensity agriculture. Icelandic agriculture is still at low intensity and lowland agricultural areas are characterized by a heterogeneous mosaic of farmed and semi-natural habi- tats, with a management gradient ranging from frequently mowed (2–3 times per year) hayfields or arable fields (pri- marily barley), to semi-natural areas with light or no man- agement (although most of this land is under some sort of grazing management) It has been postulated that there is a beneficial relationship between agricultural improvement of semi-natural land and species alpha diversity (Jóhannesdóttir et al. 2019), but that this relationship is unimodal. Agricultural practices such as liming, spreading animal manure of fields and hay cropping, when undertaken at low intensities may increase habitat and resource heterogeneity, together with enhancing soil health. This leads to increases in alpha diversity, but beyond a critical leve of agricultural intensity, alpha diversity quickly falls away due to the habitat homogenisation associated with agricultural intensification. However, the effects of cultivated land in the surrounding landscape varied with altitude (ranging from 0 to 200 m); in low- lying coastal areas, wader numbers decline with increasing amounts of cultivated land (and the lowest densities (&lt; 1 km2) occur in areas dominated with cultivated land), the inverse occurs at higher altitudes (&gt; 100 m a.s.l., where lowest densities occur in areas without cultivated land). This suggests that additional resources provided by cultivated land may be more important in the less fertile uplands. Further agricultural conversion of wetlands in low-lying areas of Iceland is likely to be detrimental for breeding waders, but such effects may be less apparent at higher altitudes. Interaction effects of agrigulature and semi-natural mosaics - positive whilst agriculre is not significant in extent or intensity. 1.6 Declines in wader populations Wader populations are declining across the world (Butchart et al. 2010), and farmland waders are one of the highest wildlife conservation priorities on Scottish farmland. The loss and degradation of natural and semi-natural breeding habitats through changing land use, particularly agricultural intensification, changes in cropping and grazing management is believed to have caused declines in farmland wader populations (Galbraith 1988, Ottvall 2005, Smart et al. 2006, Eglington et al. 2010, Showler et al. 2010, Fletcher et al. 2010, Van Dijk et al. 2015). A recent paper (Bell and Calladine 2017) reported results of a 25 year study (1990 to 2015) on a typical Scottish farm north of Stirling (a survey area of 7.5km\\(^2^\\)). The authors explain how over this time Oystercatcher have declined by 95%, Lapwing by 88%, Curlew by 67% and Redshank by 87%, from peaks of 125, 365, 57 and 53 pairs, respectively. The UK Eurasian Curlew breeding population represents 28% of the total European population and 19% of the global population (Eaton et al. 2015). The significance of the population internationally, coupled with such a large drop in UK numbers has resulted in the species being added to the UK red list. In Ireland, a former stronghold for Curlew, there are thought to be only 150 breeding pairs remaining in the entire country; a decline of 96% since the early 1990s. It is now thought that Curlew will become extinct within Ireland by 2025 (O’Donoghue 2018). 1.7 Study objective and hypotheses The objective of this study is to quantify breeding wader abundance response to various environmental covariates, particularly those associated with farmland waders. The study will investigate how habitat, topography and landscape pattern are associated with breeding wader abundance, in order to enhance conservation outcomes for farmland waders. Whilst there have been numerous UK studies on bird abundance and habitat associations, none have examined associations across Shetland using a long term dataset. For this study, data from the Shetland Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 2002 to 2019 was used (ref), together with a number of spatial datasets that represent environmental covariates. A number of hypotheses were formulated a priori as outlined in Table ??. Here predictions are made as to how the abundance per unit area (density) of breeding waders is associated with a particular covariate. Through the methods of the study, each individual hypothesis was tested for statistical significance. #waderHypo Hypothesis for associations of habitat scale and composition for breeding wader density. ID Hypothesis Wader Density H1 Farmland that is managed as improved grassland for silage has a higher pH, possibly due to liming and fertilisation, which in turn is associated with higher earthworm density (McCallum et al. 2016) Positive H2 Earthworm density is negatively associated with high organic carbon content within the topsoil, due to increased soil acidity (McCallum et al. 2016). Negative H3 Earthworm density is positively associated with higher topsoil pH (between 5.0-7.4), as common earthworm species are acid intolerant. (McCallum et al. 2016) Positive H4 Heathland is associated with insects such as Crane fly and their larvae (Tipulidae spp.), and are a major food source for wader chicks Positive H5 Semi-natural grasslands are associated with both earthworms and invertebrates, and are a major food source for wader chicks and suitable nesting sites Positive H6 Due to a lack of available food sources, peat bogs are not a key habitat for breeding waders Negative H7 Higher elevations are associated with lower food source availability per unit area, due to weather induced oligotrophic habitat such as peatland Negative H8 Coastal predators such as otters and gulls are likely to reduce breeding wader productivity, so distance from the the sea is positively associated with productivity. Coastal locations are possibly increasingly exposed to extreme weather events during the breeding season Positive H9 Bare peat in peatland habitats reduces the extent of suitable nesting and feeding habitats Negative H10 Available water capacity within the soil is an indicator of the degree of wetness of the soil which is positively associated with access to invertebrates in the topsoil Positive H11 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F with high thematic complexity indicates high habitat heterogeneity, which is associated with higher diversity oand availability of nesting and feeding habitats in close proximity Positive H12 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F with high spatially aggregation indicates high habitat homogeneity, which is associated with lower proximity of both nesting and chick feeding habitat Negative Having quantified and evaluated the response of breeding wader abundance against the study hypotheses as outlined in #waderHypo, a population model will be developed to quantify the population for farmland breeding waders from 2002-2019, acros Shetland (excluding Foula and Fair Isle). Finally a series of recommendations will be made as to conservation actions that could be undertaken to stabilise or enhance wader populations across Shetland. "]
