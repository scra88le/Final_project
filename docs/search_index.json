This nesting strategy means that the wader continuously surveils their environment for predators, immediately taking flight if an attacker enters the vicinity of the nest, and relying on the fact that eggs within the nest are cryptically marked so as to avoid detection. Groups of Oystercatcher and Lapwing can often form aerial displays in-order to ambush and deter any attackers [ref]. Most wader species exist near water and feed on invertebrates or small crustaceans by probing in mud and soil, or picking items off rocky shores in both coastal and freshwater habitats. This feeding behaviour is facilitated by the use of slender and often long bills that can be used for probing, together with relatively long legs to allow wading in shallow water when feeding. Euraisian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus - primarily lives at the coast, where it also breeds and feeds on bivalves and gastropods. Has over the last 50 years started to breed in-land on farmland, where it’s primary food source is earthworms and insect larvae. Oystercatcher have strong mate and site fidelity, where a single nesting attempt is made per breeding season. They typically lay their eggs in April and unlike other farmland waders, they will sometimes nest close to man made habitat such as buildings or on top of drystone walls. Nesting on flat gravel roofs was first noted in Aberdeen in the 1960s, with these birds often feeding in urban parks and on lawns. Unlike other waders, adults can take food to their young rather than requiring the young to move to areas where they can feed themselves; a feature which enables rooftop nesting. Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus - outside of the breeding season, they may overwinter in large flocks in-land as far south as northern Africa. Lapwing feed on insects and earthworms, and have a preference for feeding at night in order to avoid predators. As the Lapwing has a short bill, they can only forage for food near the surface of the soil. They will therefore typically nest in areas that are invertavrate rich. Lapwing often form loose colonies that can together to drive away predators. Their chicks typically hatch in early May, with replacement clutches typically in June if the first hatch failed. Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata - Scotland’s largest wader generally spend their winters near the coast and return to their breeding territories to hatch their chicks in early June. This later breeding period than Oystercatchers and Lapwings is associated with a requirement for the nest to be in vegetation (c.15cm tall or more). The Curlew can be migratory, often over wintering in Africa or Southern Europe. Though in the milder climate of Scotland it can be resident all year round. Common Redshank Tringa totanus - perhaps the least common of the farmland waders. They spend the winter at the coast, particularly on mudflats and estuaries and nest most abundantly on wetland, espeically coastal saltmarsh and machair. Pools of shallow standing water are particularly attractive to nesting Redshank, as they feed on the small invertebrates that they support. Their chicks hatch in late May. They are a migratory species, over wintering on Atlantic coasts south of Ireland and Great Britain. Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago - Snipe nest in dense cover of rushes and sedges within wetland habitats, as well as in wet scrapes and bogs in moorland habitats. They feed on invertabrates in areas of shallow standing water. They reside in farmland wetlands throughout the year. Snipe are often difficult to observe and often are only detectable by listening out for the drumming that results from their display flights. 1.2 Declines in wader populations Wader populations are declining across the world (Butchart et al. 2010), and farmland waders are one of the highest wildlife conservation priorities on Scottish farmland. A recent paper (Bell and Calladine 2017) reported results of a 25 year study (1990 to 2015) on a typical Scottish farm north of Stirling (a survey area of 7.5km\\(^2^\\). The authors explain how over this time Oystercatcher have declined by 95%, Lapwing by 88%, Curlew by 67% and Redshank by 87%, from peaks of 125, 365, 57 and 53 pairs, respectively. Changes in spring sward height, considered to be due to changes in crop type, were associated with changes in the numbers of breeding waders over time. Interestingly, the productivity by a sample of Lapwings was unchanged through the study period, indicating that other factors such as predation or adverse weather did not contribute to declines. The UK Eurasian Curlew breeding population represents 28% of the total European population and 19% of the global population (Eaton et al. 2015). This significance of the population internationally, coupled with such a large drop in UK numbers has resulted in the species being added to the UK red list. In Ireland, a former stronghold for Curlew, there are thought to be only 150 breeding pairs remaining in the entire country; a decline of 96% since the early 1990s. It is now thought that Curlew will become extinct within Ireland by 2025 (O’Donoghue 2018). 1.3 The Shetland archipelago Shetland is a subarctic archipelago located in the North Atlantic between Scotland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The total area of the islands are some 1,466 km\\(^2\\) and they experience an oceanic temperate maritime climate.Due to the relatively harsh climate, short growing season and poor soil quality, Shetland has relatively low agricultural intensification when compared to the rest of the UK. The traditional crofting approach to farming has created farmland characterised by a mosaic of low intensity cropping and grazing. These factors have helped to create a hotspot for farmland breeding waders. The most recent estimates of the Shetland breeding population are from surveys carried out in the late 1990s: 2,300 pairs of Curlew, 1,740 pairs of Lapwing, 3,350 pairs of Oystercatcher, 1,170 pairs of Redshank and 3,450 pairs of Snipe (Harvey et al. 2004) 1.4 Breeding wader abundance response to habitat types To date there has been limited research into quantifying how the abundance of breeding waders respond to habitat differences. (Franks et al. 2017) looked at how environmental covariates affected breeding Curlew. Table ?? below summarises known habitat and sward height that the farmland waders discussed above, typically select for a nesting site. #waderPrefs Habitat Preferences for Breeding Waders. Wader Breeding habitat Sward height Breeding season Oystercatcher Grassland or arable fields Short April - July Lapwing Grassland, spring crops, fallow land Bare/short April - late July Curlew Heathland, grassland and bog Long May - late July Redshank Wet grassland, wet scrapes Long May - late July Snipe Wetland, standing water Long ? With regards to the categorisation of sward height: bare - ploughed land with no emergent vegetation. This is typical of spring sowed crops short - managed (improved) grassland for grazing, or for mowing to make hayage or silage. Sward is typically less than 5cm tall. long - unimproved grassland, fallow pasture, heathland, marsh or wetland. Sward is typically 15cm or more. 1.5 Breeding wader abundance response to landscape composition and scale The size and composition of a landscape is key to sustaining a long term population of a bird species, especially one that has experienced a recent decline (Macdonald 2019). If a suitable landscape exists at the necessary scale, it will provide security against localised adverse effects such as starvation, predation, inbreeding and bad weather. This in-turn will allow populations, whose number is above a certain threshold, to survive major short-term fluctuations, in abundance (Melbourne and Hastings 2008). Understanding how abundance of breeding waders respond to the scale and composition of suitable habitat could be a major factor in helping to conserve them. 1.6 Study objectives any hypthesis Topics Introduce Shetland BBS Questions Quantify how abundance varies as a function of environmental covariates and their spatial variation (scale effect) Quantfiy how abundance varies as a function of habitat composition Quantify how population has varied from 2002 to 2019.
