This nesting strategy means that the wader continuously surveils their environment for predators, immediately taking flight if an attacker enters the vicinity of the nest, and relying on the fact that eggs within the nest are cryptically marked so as to avoid detection. Groups of Oystercatcher and Lapwing can often form aerial displays in-order to ambush and deter any attackers [ref]. Most wader species exist near water and feed on invertebrates or small crustaceans by probing in mud and soil, or picking items off rocky shores in both coastal and freshwater habitats. This feeding behaviour is facilitated by the use of slender and often long bills that can be used for probing, together with relatively long legs to allow wading in shallow water when feeding. Euraisian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus - primarily lives at the coast, where it also breeds and feeds on bivalves and gastropods. Has over the last 50 years started to breed in-land on farmland, where it’s primary food source is earthworms and insect larvae. Oystercatcher have strong mate and site fidelity, where a single nesting attempt is made per breeding season. They typically lay their eggs in April and unlike other farmland waders, they will sometimes nest close to man made habitat such as buildings or on top of drystone walls. Nesting on flat gravel roofs was first noted in Aberdeen in the 1960s, with these birds often feeding in urban parks and on lawns. Unlike other waders, adults can take food to their young rather than requiring the young to move to areas where they can feed themselves; a feature which enables rooftop nesting. Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus - outside of the breeding season, they may overwinter in large flocks in-land as far south as northern Africa. Lapwing feed on insects and earthworms, and have a preference for feeding at night in order to avoid predators. As the Lapwing has a short bill, they can only forage for food near the surface of the soil. They will therefore typically nest in areas that are invertebrate rich. Lapwing often form loose colonies when nesting, that can together drive away predators. Their chicks typically hatch in early May, with replacement clutches typically in June if the first hatch failed. Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata - Scotland’s largest wader generally spend their winters near the coast and return to their Shetland breeding territories to hatch their chicks in early June. This later breeding period than Oystercatchers and Lapwings is associated with a requirement for the nest to be in tall vegetation (c.15cm tall or more). The Curlew can be migratory, often over wintering in Africa or Southern Europe. Though in the milder climate of Scotland it can be resident all year round. Common Redshank Tringa totanus - perhaps the least common of the farmland waders. They spend the winter at the coast, particularly on mudflats and estuaries and nest most abundantly on wetland, espeically coastal saltmarsh and machair. Pools of shallow standing water are particularly attractive to nesting Redshank, as they feed on the small invertebrates that they support. Their chicks hatch in late May. They are a migratory species, over wintering on Atlantic coasts south of Ireland and Great Britain. Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago - Snipe nest in dense cover of rushes and sedges within wetland habitats, as well as in wet scrapes and bogs in moorland habitats. They feed on invertabrates in areas of shallow standing water. They reside in farmland wetlands throughout the year. Snipe are often difficult to observe and often are only detectable by listening out for the drumming that results from their display flights. 1.2 The Shetland archipelago Shetland is a subarctic archipelago located in the North Atlantic between Scotland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The total area of the islands are some 1,466 km\\(^2\\) and they experience an oceanic temperate maritime climate.Due to the relatively harsh climate, short growing season and poor soil quality, Shetland has relatively low agricultural intensification when compared to the rest of the UK. The traditional crofting approach to farming has created farmland characterised by a mosaic of low intensity cropping and grazing. These factors have helped to create a hotspot for farmland breeding waders. The most recent estimates of the Shetland breeding population are from surveys carried out in the late 1990s: 2,300 pairs of Curlew, 1,740 pairs of Lapwing, 3,350 pairs of Oystercatcher, 1,170 pairs of Redshank and 3,450 pairs of Snipe (Harvey et al. 2004) 1.3 Breeding wader abundance response to habitat types The suitability of farmland habitat for breeding waders is likely to be influenced by the historic conversion from more heterogeneous semi-natural grassland to agriculturally improved grassland through soil drainage, liming, fertilization and re-seeding. These practices can result in a structurally uniform sward with reduced invertebrate and earthworm density (Baines 1988, Vickery et al. 2001), though fertilization and liming may increase the availability of some soil invertebrates (McCallum et al. 2015). Enclosed improved grassland can provide nesting sites (O’Brien 2004), but also foraging sites for birds breeding on nearby unenclosed moorland (Robson 1998), particularly if fields have high densities of soil invertebrates. (Franks et al. 2017) looked at how environmental covariates affected breeding Curlew. A key requirement for breeding waders on farmland is the type of habitat and sward height. Table ?? below summarises typical habitat and sward height that the farmland waders discussed above, typically select for their nesting site. #waderPrefs Habitat Preferences for Breeding Waders. Wader Breeding habitat Sward height Breeding season Oystercatcher Grassland or arable fields Short April - July Lapwing Grassland, spring crops, fallow land Bare/short April - late July Curlew Heathland, grassland and bog Long May - late July Redshank Wet grassland, wet scrapes Long May - late July Snipe Wetland, standing water Long ? With regards to the categorisation of sward height: bare - ploughed land with no emergent vegetation. This is typical of spring sowed crops short - managed (improved) grassland for grazing, or for mowing to make hayage or silage. Sward is typically less than 5cm tall. long - unimproved grassland, fallow pasture, heathland, marsh or wetland. Sward is typically 15cm or more. 1.4 Breeding wader abundance response to landscape composition and scale The size and composition of a landscape is key to sustaining a long term population of a bird species, especially one that has experienced a recent decline (Macdonald 2019). If a suitable landscape exists at the necessary scale, it will provide security against localised adverse effects such as starvation, predation, inbreeding and bad weather. This in-turn will allow populations, whose number is above a certain threshold, to survive major short-term fluctuations, in abundance (Melbourne and Hastings 2008). Understanding how abundance of breeding waders respond to the scale and composition of suitable habitat could be a major factor in helping to conserve them. 1.5 The importance of agriculture to breeding waders Agriculture is generally thought to depress biodiversity but in some cases it can be beneficial, especially low-intensity agriculture. Icelandic agriculture is still at low intensity and lowland agricultural areas are characterized by a heterogeneous mosaic of farmed and semi-natural habi- tats, with a management gradient ranging from frequently mowed (2–3 times per year) hayfields or arable fields (pri- marily barley), to semi-natural areas with light or no man- agement (although most of this land is under some sort of grazing management) It has been postulated that there is a beneficial relationship between agricultural improvement of semi-natural land and species alpha diversity (Jóhannesdóttir et al. 2019), but that this relationship is unimodal. Agricultural practices such as liming, spreading animal manure of fields and hay cropping, when undertaken at low intensities may increase habitat and resource heterogeneity, together with enhancing soil health. This leads to increases in alpha diversity, but beyond a critical leve of agricultural intensity, alpha diversity quickly falls away due to the habitat homogenisation associated with agricultural intensification. However, the effects of cultivated land in the surrounding landscape varied with altitude (ranging from 0 to 200 m); in low- lying coastal areas, wader numbers decline with increasing amounts of cultivated land (and the lowest densities (&lt; 1 km2) occur in areas dominated with cultivated land), the inverse occurs at higher altitudes (&gt; 100 m a.s.l., where lowest densities occur in areas without cultivated land). This suggests that additional resources provided by cultivated land may be more important in the less fertile uplands. Further agricultural conversion of wetlands in low-lying areas of Iceland is likely to be detrimental for breeding waders, but such effects may be less apparent at higher altitudes. Interaction effects of agrigulature and semi-natural mosaics - positive whilst agriculre is not significant in extent or intensity. 1.6 Declines in wader populations Wader populations are declining across the world (Butchart et al. 2010), and farmland waders are one of the highest wildlife conservation priorities on Scottish farmland. The loss and degradation of natural and semi-natural breeding habitats through changing land use, particularly agricultural intensification, changes in cropping and grazing management is believed to have caused declines in farmland wader populations (Galbraith 1988, Ottvall 2005, Smart et al. 2006, Eglington et al. 2010, Showler et al. 2010, Fletcher et al. 2010, Van Dijk et al. 2015). A recent paper (Bell and Calladine 2017) reported results of a 25 year study (1990 to 2015) on a typical Scottish farm north of Stirling (a survey area of 7.5km\\(^2^\\)). The authors explain how over this time Oystercatcher have declined by 95%, Lapwing by 88%, Curlew by 67% and Redshank by 87%, from peaks of 125, 365, 57 and 53 pairs, respectively. The UK Eurasian Curlew breeding population represents 28% of the total European population and 19% of the global population (Eaton et al. 2015). The significance of the population internationally, coupled with such a large drop in UK numbers has resulted in the species being added to the UK red list. In Ireland, a former stronghold for Curlew, there are thought to be only 150 breeding pairs remaining in the entire country; a decline of 96% since the early 1990s. It is now thought that Curlew will become extinct within Ireland by 2025 (O’Donoghue 2018). 1.7 Study objective and hypotheses The objective of this study is to quantify breeding wader abundance response to various environmental covariates, particularly those associated with farmland waders. The study will investigate how habitat, topography and landscape pattern are associated with breeding wader abundance, in order to enhance conservation outcomes for farmland waders. Whilst there have been numerous UK studies on bird abundance and habitat associations, none have examined associations across Shetland using a long term dataset. For this study, data from the Shetland Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 2002 to 2019 was used (ref), together with a number of spatial datasets that represent environmental covariates. A number of hypotheses were formulated a priori as outlined in Table ??. Here predictions are made as to how the abundance per unit area (density) of breeding waders is associated with a particular covariate. Through the methods of the study, each individual hypothesis was tested for statistical significance. #waderHypo Hypothesis for associations of habitat scale and composition for breeding wader density. ID Hypothesis Wader Density H1 Farmland that is managed as improved grassland for silage has a higher pH, possibly due to liming and fertilisation, which in turn is associated with higher earthworm density (McCallum et al. 2016) Positive H2 Earthworm density is negatively associated with high organic carbon content within the topsoil, due to increased soil acidity (McCallum et al. 2016). Negative H3 Earthworm density is positively associated with higher topsoil pH (between 5.0-7.4), as common earthworm species are acid intolerant. (McCallum et al. 2016) Positive H4 Heathland is associated with insects such as Crane fly and their larvae (Tipulidae spp.), and are a major food source for wader chicks Positive H5 Semi-natural grasslands are associated with both earthworms and invertebrates, and are a major food source for wader chicks and suitable nesting sites Positive H6 Due to a lack of available food sources, peat bogs are not a key habitat for breeding waders Negative H7 Higher elevations are associated with lower food source availability per unit area, due to weather induced oligotrophic habitat such as peatland Negative H8 Coastal predators such as otters and gulls are likely to reduce breeding wader productivity, so distance from the the sea is positively associated with productivity. Coastal locations are possibly increasingly exposed to extreme weather events during the breeding season Positive H9 Bare peat in peatland habitats reduces the extent of suitable nesting and feeding habitats Negative H10 Available water capacity within the soil is an indicator of the degree of wetness of the soil which is positively associated with access to invertebrates in the topsoil Positive H11 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F with high thematic complexity indicates high habitat heterogeneity, which is associated with higher diversity oand availability of nesting and feeding habitats in close proximity Positive H12 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F with high spatially aggregation indicates high habitat homogeneity, which is associated with lower proximity of both nesting and chick feeding habitat Negative Having quantified and evaluated the response of breeding wader abundance against the study hypotheses as outlined in #waderHypo, a population model will be developed to quantify the population for farmland breeding waders from 2002-2019, acros Shetland (excluding Foula and Fair Isle). Finally a series of recommendations will be made as to conservation actions that could be undertaken to stabilise or enhance wader populations across Shetland. "],

The remote islands of Foula and Fair Isle were removed from the study area. 2.2 Breeding wader survey data Two independent sets of survey data were used to provide spatial abundance for breeding waders. The Shetland Breeding Bird Survey (SBBS) is a citizen science project that is overseen by the Shetland Biological Records Centre. The SBBS is an annual survey undertaken since 2002, whereby local volunteers select a 1km Ordnance Survey 1km\\(^2\\) to survey. It is important to note that to encourage volunteer uptake, these squares are not randomly allocated in space; typically the location of the survey is selected by the volunteer. There are 3992 1km squares that cover the Shetland archipelago; excluding Fair Isle and Foula. Volunteers walk either a 2km transect around their chosen square, or two 1km transects that bisect the square. All breeding bird species observed 100m either side of the transect are recorded. All transects were walked twice, typically April to mid-May and mid-May to late June. All surveys were undertaken before 9am and in good weather (wind force four or less, and dry). The annual abundance recorded for each breeding species within a given square is the maximum of count from the two visits. Upto 2019 there have been 139 different OS 1km squares surveyed as part of the SBBS. Although the survey runs every year, not all 139 survey squares have been covered annually. Since 2002, new squares have been introduced over the years, some are no longer covered, and there are some gaps when volunteers have been unable to carry out surveys. The RSPB have undertaken annual field based surveys across a number of well-known Shetland breeding wader sites since 1987 (Campbell and Ellis 1987). The initial survey covered 33,000 ha or 293 sites of inbye land; this is land that is lowland rough grassland, and is typically not farmed intensively. From the 1987 survey, 6900 ha or 122 sites were identified. The survey data used in this study was recorded between 2013 and 2018 and are taken from up-to 29 sites, a subset of the original 1987 sites. The survey method (O’Brien and Murray 1998) required observers to walk to within 100m of every part of the survey site and to complete their survey between dawn and 12:00 hours. Three visits were made, one in each of the periods 15 April-30 April, 1 May-21 May and 22 May-18 June. Successive visits were separated by at least a week. Cold, wet or windy weather conditions were avoided. Each wader observed was recorded against a specific field. The method for calculating the breeding wader abundance recorded was species specific: Lapwing, Oystercatcher and Redshank abundance was recorded as the total numbers of birds seen in each field; Snipe—the number of drumming plus chipping birds in each field; for Curlew the mean count of individual Curlew (MNI) over three standard survey visits to each site was calculated, and the numbers of nesting pairs was calculated as 0.71 MNI + 0.10 (Grant et al. 2000). 2.3 Estimating detectability The two surveys in question assumed perfect detectability of the survey species. Due to the imprecise nature of field surveys this could result in a bias in species detectability, which could further result in inaccurate population estimates. To account for this bias, there are a number of sophisticated statistical techniques such as distance sampling that account for this, in order to reduce the standard error associated with a population estimate (Newson et al. 2008). Such techniques typically require more structured survey techniques such as precisely measuring the distance and angle, between the target and the transect line. Unfortunately this data was not available for the two survey datasets used within the study. Inorder to generate a probabiliy of detection, and therefore account for detectability bias, the r-package unmarked (Fiske and Chandler 2011) was used to generate a probability of detection for each species. Unmarked adopts a generative modelling process whereby observations are modelled through a combination of (1) a state process determining abundance at each site and (2) a detection process that yields observations conditional on the state process. Probability of detection (detectability) was modelled using unmarked for each species by using count data across multiple sites within and years, using day of year as a covariate. An average was then taken across years to give an average detectability for each species. 2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis An exploratory data analysis was undertaken on the SBBS dataset as per the protocol outlined in Zuur (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010). In addition survey locations were plotted spatially across each survey year in order to gauge survey effort. Outliers were removed etc etc 2.5 Environmental covariates Environmental covariates were generated with values spatially assigned to each Ordnance Survey (OS) grid cell, at 1km resolution. The grid reference was generated to match the SBBS survey data. The spatial extent of the covariate grid excluded the remote islands of Foula and Fair Isle in order to reduce computational time when fitting spatial abundance models. The following environmental covariates were quantified for the OS squares and periods studied: 2.5.1 EUNIS habitat classification The EUNIS habitat classification is a European wide system for habitat classification (“EUNIS” 2014). For the purposes of EUNIS, a ‘habitat’ is defined as: ‘a place where plants or animals normally live, characterized primarily by its physical features (topography, plant or animal physiognomy, soil characteristics, climate, water quality etc.) and secondarily by the species of plants and animals that live there’ Each habitat type is identified by specific codes and a description. The classification of terrestrial habitat is hierarchical and comprises three levels. For the purpose of this study the level 1 classification was used so as not to overdisperse the response variable (breeding wader abundnace). The EUNIS dataset is available as a categorical GeoTiff file, at a resolution of 10x10m. The level 1 EUNIS categorisation is shown in Table 2.1. Table 2.1: EUNIS habiat classificaiton L1 Classification Habitat Description A Marine habitats B Coastal habitats C Inland surface waters D Mires, bogs and fens E Grasslands and lands dominated by forbs, mosses or lichens F Heathland, scrub and tundra G Woodland, forest and other wooded land H Inland unvegetated or sparsely vegetated habitats I Regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats J Constructed, industrial and other artificial habitats K Montane habitats X Habitat complexes A raster file containing the EUNIS habitat classification for Scotland in 2019 was cropped to the extent of the Shetland archipelago, and the percentage coverage of habitat classes D, E and F were calculated for each OS square (n=3000?). Wader breeding sites are assumed to be predominantly within D, E and F habitats. 2.5.2 Improved grassland Across Shetland crofters have improved parcels of low-lying grassland in-order to take an annual crop of haylage or silage. It is typically used as fodder for sheep and cattle during the long winter season. This habitat is an important environmental covariate for studying breeding waders, as it has been suggested that improved grasslands are an important feeding habitat for nesting waders and their chicks (McCallum et al. 2018). Improved grassland is not a specific category within the EUNIS habitat classification, rather it is included within Grasslands class (E), which also covers unimproved and rough grasslands. Consequently remotely sensed satellite image data were used together with supervised machine learning techniques (Abdi 2020) to generate a spatial classification for Shetland improved grassland. A Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Shetland archipelago, comprising 11 different spectral bands (“Sentinel-2” 2020) , was used to produce an improved grassland raster layer. This was achieved by using the r programming language (R Core Team 2019) to train both a support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used in conjunction with the tidymodels package (Kuhn and Wickham 2020) to classify each raster cell, according to the spectral band values within it. Training datasets comprising polygons were created across five different habitat classes: improved grassland, unimproved grassland, upland, bare peat and crops. 1000 spatial samples were randomly drawn from each class training dataset; a sample comprising a value for each of the 11 spectral bands, for the specific sample location. The aggregate training dataset , comprising 5000 samples, was then split into training and testing data. The training data was subsequently resampled using 5-Fold cross-validation in order to reduce variability of the model classification. The hyperparameters of a radial basis SVM were tuned and the best model was selected based on an accuracy metric validated against the test data split. The model fit was then used to make a prediction for improved grassland over the entire Shetland archipelago. 2.5.3 Median topsoil pH content A shape file detailing the median topsoil pH content across Shetland was provided by the James Hutton Institute. A higher soil pH has been shown to be associated with greater earthworm abundance [McCallum2016-jt], which is one of the main food sources of breeding farmland waders and their chicks. The weighted median pH was calculated for each SBBS OS 1km square at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.4 Topsoil organic carbon content A shape file containing the topsoil organic carbon content (by percentage of overall weight) was downloaded from the James Hutton Institue (Lilly, A and Baggaley, N and Donnelly, D. 2012). The topsoil of grasslands store significant amount of Carbon (Eze, Palmer, and Chapman 2018) through the accumulation of organic matter. Therefore fertile grasslands favoured by waders may have significant carbon stored within the topsoil, whilst grassland that is heavily grazed by livestock may have relatively low carbon storage.The mean topsoil organic carbon content was calculated for each SBBS OS 1km square at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.5 Available water capacity Available water capacity (AWC) is the amount of water a soil can provide for plants, and so is a useful indicator of the ability of soils to grow crops. The amount of moisture in the soil is thought to be an important aspect of wader abundance (Smart et al. 2006). A shape file detailing the AWC across Shetland was downloaded from the James Hutton Institute (Gagkas, Z., Lilly, A., Baggaley, N. &amp; Donnelly, D. 2019), and the mean AWC across each SBBS 1km square was calculated at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.6 Bare peatland Shetland has a significant amount of degraded peatland, due to natural wind and water erosion, worsened by past land management practices such as overgrazing and damaging methods of peat cutting for use as fuel. It is expected that the resulting bare peat is negatively associated with breeding waders. Scottish Natural Heritage have produced a shapefile of bare peat, at a resolution of 10x10m (Blake 2020). The percentage cover of bare peat for each SBBS 1km square was calculated, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.7 Distance to sea Proximity of breeding wader territory to the coast as in-land breeding sites could be more sheltered from Shetland’s maritime weather. For each SBBS 1km square the mean distance to the coast was calculated using a raster for the Shetland landmass. 2.5.8 Elevation the r package elevatr (Hollister and Tarak Shah 2017) was used to generate a mean elevation above sea level for each SBBS 1km square. 2.6 Bootstrap analysis of SBBS survey squares As SBBS survey volunteers were able to choose which squares to survey, they are not randomly allocated. As such this may not be a true representation of the distribution of habitat types across Shetland. In order to analyse any potential bias in the habitat types surveyed, a bootstrap analysis was performed across all OS 1km squares, using the EUNIS habitat categorisation. This was then compared against a bootstrap of surveyed 1km squares from a single SBBS survey year (2018). This provides a quantification of how biased survey samples are with respect to the overall Shetland landmass. 2.7 Wader food response 2.8 Breeding wader density response to environmental covariates To investigate how breeding wader abundance responds to environmental covariates a generalised additive model (GAM) was used. The approach is an extension of work undertaken to look at breeding Curlew density undertaken by the BTO (Franks et al. 2017). Species count data from the SBBS was split into two time periods, each covering nine years; 2002-10 and 2011-19. Then for each species and each surveyed square within the two time periods, a mean count was derived for each of the two time periods and joined with the respective environmental covariates, as a function of spatial location. Breeding wader counts were modelled using a log link function with a poisson distribution in R using the gam function in the mgcv package (Wood 2003). Location coordinates of survey squares were converted to planar OSGB36 national Grid coordinates as normalized easting and northing (in meters). Spatial variability in wader abundance was modelled as a spatial smooth, with the number of knots constrained (k = 20) and environmental covariates included as a parametric term. A different gam was generated for each environmental covariate, in order to explore univariate associations between response and covariate. To explore absolute abundance of breeding wader species per 1km\\(^2\\) the natural log of the average detectability per species was included as an offset within each gam model. The gam structure is summarised in equation (2.1). \\[\\begin{equation} log(E(Y)) = s(easting, northing, k=20) + \\beta _1 X_{i1} + log(Z_i) + \\epsilon _i \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] , where X is the environmental covariate, Y is species count per surveyed square, Z is average species detectability. Associations between response and the spatial effect of environmental covariate were determined by the resulting p value of the gam fit. Only those models with p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Plots of density (abundance per 1km\\(^2\\)) against each environmental covariate were generated in order to visualise the trend of any association between response and covariate. 2.9 Breeding wader population change as a response to environmental covariates Given models for breeding wader density response against environmental covariates across two distinct time ranges, a new set of models were created to model the change in abundance between 2002-10 and 2011-19 by using the count in 2011-19 as the response, and the natural log of the 2002-10 count as an offset. It is assumed that detectability remained constant within each \\(1km^2\\) square, which in turn means that changes in count reflect changes in density, against a given environmental covariate. Only SBBS squares that were surveyed in both periods and where breeding waders were present in 2002-10 where used, as it is not possible to take the natural log of zero. the population change ration was then plotted against each environmental covariate, in order to determine the nature of any popultion decline (or increase) as a function of the given environmental covariate. 2.10 Habitat spatial complexity response In order to investigate an association between breeding wader abundance and the complexity of habitat spatial patterns within the landscape, metrics using information theory (IT) (Nowosad and Stepinski 2019) were applied to quantify habitat pattern complexity of all SBBS squares across Shetland. Results from each metric were then incorporated into gam density response and population change models as covariates, in order to explore if varying degrees of habitat spatial pattern are statistically correlated with breeding wader abundance. The r package landscapemetrics (Hesselbarth et al. 2019) was used to generate all IT metrics, using the EUNIS habitat raster for Shetland as a spatially distributed categorisation of landscape habitat. A description of the different metrics incorporated in the analysis is as follows: Marginal Entropy, H(X) - measures the compositional diversity of habitats in space; from mono-thematic patterns (lower H(X)) to multi-thematic patterns (large (H(X)). So landscapes with one dominating habitat (for example, peatland on the Shetland island of Yell) have a relatively low H(X), whilst landscapes with multiple different types of habitat that are evenly distributed (such as a village with a patch work of gardens, housing and undeveloped land) have a relatively high H(X). This can be seen in Figure 2.1, with H(X) shown above each landscape sample. Figure 2.1: Marginal Entropy Conditional Entropy, H(Y|X) - quantifies the geometric intricacy of a spatial pattern within a landscape. If habitat type A is predominantly adjacent to habitat type B, H(Y|X) will be relatively low. Conversely if habitat type A is adjacent to many different habitat categories, then H(Y|X) will be relatively high. Figure 2.2 gives some examples of this. Figure 2.2: Conditional Entropy Joint Entropy, H(X,Y) - this provides a measure of the uncertainty in determining the habitat category of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. So landscapes with high H(X,Y) are typically spatially complex with many different habitat types. Note that joint entropy is not capable of distinguishing between patterns that have high spatial aggregation. The variation can be seen in Figure 2.3 . Figure 2.3: Joint Entropy Relative mutual information, U - quantifies the degree of aggregation (clumpliness) of spatial habitat categories from fragmented patterns (lower U) to consolidated patterns (higher U). A landscape comprising a loch within a forest would have a relatively high U, whilst a landscape comprising many different crop types spread across many small fields would have low U. Figure 2.4 gives a mutual entropy landscape Figure 2.4: Relative Mututal Entropy 2.11 Wader population abundance modelling Given the set of environmental covariates for each SBBS 1km\\(^2\\) square and the associated SBBS count data, a machine learning approach using rand the tidymodels (Kuhn and Wickham 2020) package was taken to fit a regression model. The resulting model enabled an annual population to be generated for each breeding wader species across all of Shetland, from the 2002 to 2019, as a function of environmental covariates. In order to fit the model the count data for each species were adjusted according to their mean detectability. All count data for a given SBBS 1km square was joined with the associated environmental covariate data. The joined data were thens plit such that 70% was allocated to model training and 30% to model testing. The training data were then processed so that covariates that have 80% absolute correlations with other covariates are removed; this ensures that possible adverse outcomes due to co-linearity are minimised (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010). The covariate data within the training dataset were then normalised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. An extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) algorithm was used to fit a regression model using a poisson distribution. 10-fold cross validation was used to resample the data in order to ensure any bias in SBBS survey squares was minimised. Hyperparameters used to fit the xgboost model were selected using a grid containing 20 random variations for each hyperparameter: min_n - the minimum number of data points in a node that are required for the node to be split further) trees - the number of trees contained in the ensemble mtry - the number of predictors (covariates) that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree models. A model was fit for each hyperparameter combination and for each species; giving 200 different models. The best model fit for each each species was selected according to the lowest root mean squared error (rmse). The hyperparamters associated with each best fit were then used to further tune the model for a final fit. The rmse for the final fit was then evaluated against the test dataset, for each species. Finally, to generate an annual population account across all over Shetland for each species, the final model fit was used across all SBBS 1km squares (n=?). This gave a mean estimate for abundance for each square, plus a lower and upper confidence interval. Summing up these values across all squares, for each species by year, gave an overall population estimate across Shetland for the years 2002 to 2019. 2.12 Lapwing population association with reseeded grassland Given the population abundance estimate modelled in [ref], a specific association between the Lapwing population trend over time and agricultural census data (Scottish Government et al. 2003) was investigated. Specifically different types of annual grassland holdings in Shetland were used as covariate in a regression analysis between 2002 and 2017. The data were tested for normality and it was found that they were log-normally distributed, and a generalised additive model for location scale and shape was used to fit the response variable, Lapwing population over time. 2.13 Wader spatial distribution modelling Having generated an abundance prediction for each SBBS square, the spatial abundance can be plotted using the spatial coordinates for each SBBS square. Spatial distributions were plotted for 2002 and 2019 in order to visualise spatial abundance distribution between the two periods, for each species. The net change between the two periods was also plotted so as to visualise the areas of Shetland that have seen a net increase or decrease in species abundance between 2002 and 2019. "],

It seems that there has been ongoing surveying effort in the south and central mainland and on the islands of Unst, Bressay and Noss, but less coverage elsewhere. Figure 3.1: Number of years a SBBS 1km square was survyered (n) between 2002 and 2019 3.1.2 Outliers The Cleveland dot plot (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010) is a chart in which the row number of an observation is plotted versus the observation variable, thereby providing a more detailed view of individual observations than a boxplot. Points that stick out on the right-hand side, or on the left-hand side, are observed values that are considerably larger, or smaller, than the majority of the observations. Figure 3.2 appears to show that there are no major outliers across all species, but that there are many counts equal to zero indicating that the data might be zero-inflated. Figure 3.2: Cleveland dot plot of species counts in Shetland BBS data from 2002 to 2018 3.1.3 Testing for normality A large number of statistical regression techniques assume normality. Visualising the SBBS count data as a histogram can help assess if it is normally distributed. This is shown in the plot in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3: Histogram of SBBS count data across all years, by species Inorder to validate the outcome of the plots in Figure 3.3 a significance test was undertaken and the results are shown in Table ??. Species W p-value OC 0.8628058 0 L 0.7546102 0 CU 0.8327195 0 RK 0.6995970 0 SN 0.8000661 0 The p-value for each species in ?? is &lt;&lt; 0.05. This suggests that the count data for all species are significantly different from the normal distribution. 3.1.4 Poisson distribution and zero inflation The histograms of species counts in Figure 3.3 suggest that count data is poisson distribution. Also there are a significant number of zeros in the count data, for all species. This suggests that the zero-inflation poisson distribution describes the data. Table ?? below shows the results of a significance test (Broek 1995) for zero inflation in a poisson distribution. Species Expected zeros Zeros observed Chi squared p-value CU 223.9173 433 384.2445 0 L 323.5230 585 547.5071 0 OC 119.1142 309 446.9641 0 RK 520.3458 694 271.6801 0 SN 134.4406 359 577.9990 0 All results have a significant statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) and therefore the count distribution across species is assumed to be a zero-inflated poisson process. The statistical modelling methods used on the data must support a poisson distribution and zero inflation where possible. 3.1.5 Homogeniety of variance Homogeneity of variance within the data is an important assumption in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other regression-related models. The series of boxplots in Figure 3.4 show how counts across all surveyed BBS squares vary across years 2002 to 2018, for each breeding wader species. Figure 3.4: Box plot showing variance of counts across all surveyed Shetland BBS squares and all years, by species To test the homogeneity of variance of species counts between years, for each species, we can apply the Fligner-Killeen test. This is used as the count data are shown to be non-normal. Table 3.1 shows the results of the test applied to the Shetland BBS data. For p-values &gt; 0.05 the data variance are homogeneous. Table 3.1: Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variance for Shetland SBBS species counts, across all years Species Chi-squared p-value df OC 18.11614 0.3171401 16 L 29.11514 0.0231712 16 CU 18.36325 0.3030590 16 RK 26.72879 0.0445979 16 SN 47.40824 0.0000588 16 Lapwing, Redshank and Snipe variances are heterogeneous according to the test results in Table 3.1. The solution to heterogeneity of variance is to transform the response variable to stabilize the variance year-on-year, or applying statistical regression techniques that do not require homogeneity. 3.1.6 Status of surveys between 2002 and 2019 Before any detailed statistical modelling was undertaken a simple analysis into how the population changed in each surveyed 1km square between 2002-2011 and 2012-2019. The 1 km squares shown (n=139) were those surveyed in both periods and where farmland waders colonized, increased, remained stable, declined or went extinct. This gave an initial view as to potential population trends between the two stated periods. Figure 3.5 shows the state changes between the two analysis periods. Figure 3.5: Population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 Figure 3.6 below shows an aggregation of certain categories; whereby extinct and decreased are grouped, and colonised and increased are grouped. Figure 3.6: Aggregate population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 3.1.7 Survey Bootstrap Shetland BBS volunteers were able to choose which squares they surveyed. The survey squares are therefore not randomly allocated across the Shetland archipelago. As a result of this non-randomised allocation there could be potential bias in the habitat types surveyed; for example, in-bye is closer to roads and housing than upland habitats. To test this a bootstrap of percentage cover of EUNIS habitat categories D, E and F (see 2.1) across all OS 1km squares was undertaken, and then compared to a bootstrap of the same data, but only those OS squares surveyed by volunteers as part of the Shetland BBS. Figure 3.7: Mean % cover per 1km\\(^2\\) of EUNIS habitat types D, E and F, bootstrap sample of OSGB squares v boostrap of surveyed squares. R=1000 This shows that grassland and heathland are significantly oversampled within the Shetland BBS surveys. 3.2 Detectability The r package unmarked was used to generate an estimate for the probability of detection, or detectability. Table ?? shows the average detectability across all survey years, for each species. Species Detectability OC 0.803 L 0.723 RK 0.667 CU 0.831 SN 0.723 3.3 Improved grassland classification The results below detail how remotely sensed satellite data was processed using a Support Vector Machine to generate a classification for improved grassland across the various islands of Shetland. 3.3.1 Shetland Sentinel 2 satelitte dataset A Sentinel 2 satellite spatial dataset was clipped using the Integrated Administration And Control System (IACS) field boundary shapefile for Shetland. This gave a spatial dataset comprising of land-based habitat only, excluding built areas and roads, as shown in Figure 3.8 Figure 3.8: Clipped Sentinel 2 RGB composite of Shetland 3.3.2 Sentinel 2 spectral bands used in habitat classification The Sentinel dataset is represented as a layered set of images (a raster) known as a RasterBrick (Hijmans 2020). Each raster layer is a spatial representation of one of 11 different spectral sensor readings. The sensors used within the Shetland sentinel dataset are shown in Table ??.

A number of areas representative of each habitat type were selected as can be seen in Figure 3.9. ## Reading layer `Training_samples&#39; from data source `/Users/anthony/Documents/GitHub/shetlandwaders/data/training_data_classification/Training_samples.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 161 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 415800.5 ymin: 1108793 xmax: 466132.7 ymax: 1217616 ## CRS: EPSG:27700 Figure 3.9: Habitat classification training areas 3.3.4 Sampling of habitat training classes Each habitat training dataset was randomly sampled in order to train a support vector machine classifier. Distributions for the sampled data for each training set are shown in Figure 3.10. The NIR and red vegetation spectra appear to be the most distinct across different habitat types. Figure 3.10: Sampled distributions for each training class, from the Sentinel 2 dataset of the Shetland landmass 3.3.5 Support vector machine classifier training The SVM was trained to classify the five target habitat classes so that improved grassland can be separated and used as a covariate in wader response modelling. 3.3.6 Search grid parameterisation The SVM parameters used to create a number of different models are shown in Table ??.

The results of classifier accruracy are shown in Table ??. Metric Estimate accuracy 0.8534091 kap 0.8240900 The confusion matrix in Figure 3.12 shows the results of the model prediction for each habitat class against thsoe of the test data set. The most incorrectly classified habitat is improved grassland versus crop, followed by Upland versus Bare Peatland. Both of these inaccuracies are not significant to the objective of producing an overall classification for improved grassland, in that crop habitat is often reseeded impproved grassland. Figure 3.12: Confusion Matrix from classificaton of test dataset 3.3.9 Classification across all Shetland habitat The best fit model was then used across the raster dataset for all of Shetland, to enable classification of all habitat. The results are shown in 3.13. The improved grassland and crop habitat is predominantly in the south of the island. It can be seen that the main middle island, Yell, is predominantly upland and bare peat. Figure 3.13: Classification of Shetland habitat in order to determine the location of improved grassland 3.4 Environmental covariate analysis Each of the covariates described in {#environmental-covariates} was generated for each Shetland BBS squares (n=3992). 3.4.1 Histogram of environmental covariates Figure 3.14 shows histograms of for these covariates for data taken across all Shetland OS GB 1km squares. It can be seen that bog type habitat predominates across Shetland, and that majority of the landscape is at less than 100m elevation. The mode for the pH is around 4, which is typical for acidic peatland (Paterson 2011). The topsoil carbon content shows that the majority of the Shetland soils have a high organic carbon content, that is typical of peatland (Paterson 2011). In contrast a typical mineral rich soil in England would have c.3-5% organic carbon content. Figure 3.14: Histograms of environmental covariates across all of Shetland 3.4.2 Histogram of environmental covariates for Shetland BBS squares only This can be contrasted with covariate histograms for only those OS squares (n=139) that were surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS, as seen in Figure 3.15. It seems across all nesting wader species, there is a preference for wet but not water-logged habitat as seen in the AWC histogram. Also, the majority of breeding waders appear to nest within 1km of the coast. It appears that breeding waders also have a preference for grassland (both improved and unimproved) presents the majority of the habitat cover, over heathland. Figure 3.15: Histograms of environmental covariates across only those squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS 3.4.3 Density plots Density plots of all environmental covariates across Shetland BBS squares (n=139) are shown in Figure 3.16. These figures provide an overlay to the histogramsin {#histogram-of-environmental-covariates-for-shetland-bbs-squares-only}, and represent a smoothed version of a histogram to show the probability density function of the variable. Some distributions are highly skewed, such as distance to sea and elevation. Whilst other covariates like topsoil organic carbon and bog cover are largely a uniformly distributed. None of the covariates appear to be normally distributed. Figure 3.16: Density plots of environmental covariates against breeding wader count data 3.5 Environmental covariate response GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002–10 and 2011-19. They included 10 environmental predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 3.5.1 Environmental covariate GAM model parameters Table ?? shows the GAM model parameters for the model fits for the two periods where abundance response (density) was modelled, and the associated plots showing breeding wader density against each environmental covariate are shown in Figure ??. The statistically significant correlations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate are summarised for each species in heatmaps; Figure 3.17 for 2002-10 and Figure 3.18 for 2011-2019. Figure 3.17: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2010 inclusive For the 2002-10 survey period in Figure 3.17, it can be seen that pH is only statistically significant for one species (Snipe), whilst topsoil organic carbon and grassland are oppositely correlated. Distance to sea is perhaps the most interesting covariate in that Lapwing show greater density at the coast whilst Curlew, Oystercatcher and Snipe show greater densities inland. Figure 3.18: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive In Figure 3.18 we can see that there are fewer associations that are not statistically significant. For Curlew it is seen that all covariate associations are now statistically significant (versus 2002-2010 where pH and Heathland cover were not significant). Oystercatcher also have all covariates with statistically significant associations, but for the later survey period the distance to association is now negative with increase distance. Lapwing only have one covariate, pH, that is not statistically significant. For Redshank the main change in the later survey period is that Heathland percentage cover is now statistically significant, and has a positive association. Snipe now have a positive association with available water capacity and a negative association with percentage bog cover. 3.5.2 Environmental covariate GAM model plots Figures ??show the response of wader density to each environmental covariate, for the survey periods 2002-10 and 2011-19. 3.6 Population change model against environmental covariates By using the response of the 2002-2010 wader densities as the offset for the 2011-19 densities, a third series of GAMs were fitted to show the ratio of population change in response to environmental covariates. This is shown in Figure 3.19. Figure 3.19: Summary of population change ratio associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2019 inclusive Figure 3.19 suggests that the environmental covariates with that have had the most positive associations with breeding wader density are heathland percentage cover and available water capacity, whilst the percentage of bare peatland has had no statistical significance, followed by the percentage grassland cover that has only one negative association with the population change ratio of Redshank. The model parameters and associated plots for population change ratio modelling are shown in Figures ?? and Table ?? respectively. 3.7 Information Theory (IT) covariates GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002–10 and 2011-19. They included 5 IT predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 3.7.1 Histograms of Information theory covariates Histograms of IT covariates using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, across all of Shetland are shown in figure 3.20. The marginal entropy for the Shetland landscape is approximately normally distributed, indicating that habitat within the Shetland landscape is spatially diverse but that very low and highly diverse habitat within Shetland are relatively rare. The mode of the conditional entropy is relatively low with a distribution that shows significant positive skew; this suggests that the Shetland landscape has relatively low geometric intricacy. This arises when cells of one category within a landscape raster are predominantly adjacent to cells of the same category. The overall spatio-thematic complexity is measured by joint entropy. This can be thought of as quantifying the uncertainty in determining the habitat type of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. For Shetland, joint entropy appears to be approximately normally distributed. This indicates that habitat with very high or low spatio-thematic complexity is relatively rare on Shetland. Due to the spatial autocorrelation, the value of mutual information tends to grow with a diversity of the landscape (marginal entropy). To adjust this tendency, it is possible to calculate relative mutual information by dividing the mutual information by the marginal entropy. Relative mutual information always has a range between 0 and 1, and quantifies the degree of aggregation of spatial habitat. It can be seen that for Shetland, relative mutual information is distributed with significant negative skew. This implies that habitat types across Shetland are predominantly aggregated - small relatively information values indicate significant fragmentation in landscape habitat patterns. Figure 3.20: Histograms of Information Theory covariates across all Shetland OS 1km squares 3.7.2 Histograms of Information Theory covariates for surveyed squares only 1km squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS were used to generate IT covariates histograms using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, as shown in Figure 3.21. Here we can see that the conditional entropy and the marginal entropy across all surveyed squares had a mode that was significantly higher than the Shetland wide values shown in Figure 3.20. There is also significantly less negative negative skew in the relative mutual information of the surveyed squares. Figure 3.21: Histograms of Information Theory covariates across SBBS surveyed sqaures only 3.7.3 Information Theory covariates abundance response model Here we generate GAMs using IT metrics as covariates against breeding wader abundance data. Figures 3.22 and 3.23 summarise the associations between the abundance response and IT covariates used in the univariate GAMs, for the periods 2002-10 and 2011-19 respectively. Figure 3.22: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and IT covariates, between 2002 and 2010 inclusive Figure 3.23: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and IT covariates, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive Table ?? shows the GAM parameters generated by fitting the model to the data. Plots for abundance response against IT covariates are shown in Figure ??. 3.7.4 Population change model against IT covarirates By using the response of the 2002-2010 wader densities as the offset for the 2011-19 densities, a third series of GAMs were fitted to show the ratio of population change in response to environmental covariates. This is summarised in Figure 3.24. It can be seen that there are no statistically significant results for Redshank or Snipe, or for marginal entropy as a covariate. Figure 3.24: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and IT covariates, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive Table ?? shows the GAM parameters generated by fitting the population change model to the data. Plots for population change response against IT covariates are shown in Figure ??. 3.8 Wader abundance trends A random forest regression model was used to fit abundance response, given a set of 10 environmental covariates. The number of trees in the model hyper-parameters was set to 1000, and the number of predictors sampled at each split (mtry) together the minimum number of data points that cause a node to split furthter (min_n) were tuned using a search grid containing ten points in the hyper plane. 3.8.1 Tuning model hyper parameters The tuning grid over 10 different folds gave the results for the different hyper parameter permutations as shown in Figure ?? - each figure show the results for a particular species. Each parameter is plotted against the resulting root mean squared error (rmse). 3.8.2 Further model hyper parameter tuning The model fit was refined further by searching over a revised hypergrid range for each species. The range used was that which gave the lowest rmse as given in Figure ??. The results of the revised tuning grid can be seen in Figure ??. From the plot in figure xxx we can see which hyper parameters give the best fit, when using root mean squared error as an evaluation metric. It can be seen that the model fit for Snipe has the largest RMSE and Redshank, the lowest. For each species the minimum rmse given by the best model fit, together with the associated hyper parameters (trees= 1000 for all models) is shown in Table ??. 3.8.3 Variable importance in model fit Having selected the best model fit the variable importance for each species was assessed. The r vip package can be used to explore the relative importance of different covariates in the model fit. The results are shown in Figure ??. It can be seen that pH, X (longitude) and grassland percentage coverage for a given OS 1km square are the most important covariates for predicting abundance in Curlew. For Lapwing, pH, heathland percentage coverage and topsoil organic carbon content are the most important variables. Whilst for Oystercatcher, grassland and heathland percentage cover are almost equivalent in their importance followed by longitude. For Redshank and Snipe, available water capacity and heathland are the most important covariates in predicting abundance. 3.8.4 Generate population estimate over time The random forest regression model was used to predict species abundance over all (n=3992) Shetland BBS 1km squares. The model gave a mean estimate together with lower and upper confidence intervals (5% and 95% percentiles respectively), across every year the survey was run (2002 to 2019). The results are shown in Table ?? and plotted Figure 3.25 Figure 3.25: Shetland breeding wader abundance by year Across the years 2002 to 2019 the abundance of breeding waders across all species appear to have decreased, with the exception of Snipe. The most significant decline was breeding Lapwing abundance. Note that the confidence intervals for Snipe are highly variable in certain years. Table ?? shows the change in breeding wader abundance by species between 2002 and 2019.

A linear regression was plotted for Lapwing abundance versus each grassland categorisation (in Hectares) as shown in Figure 3.26. Figure 3.26: Association between the size of grassland categories on Shetland and Lapwing population abundance Figure 3.26 show’s that Lapwing population size is clearly positively associated with the size of grassland that is less than five years old (that grassland which has been reseeded) and tillage (land prepared for spring crops). Futhermore, Figure 3.26 shows that Lapwing population abundance is negatively associated with grassland that is not reseeded (Grass &gt;= 5y). The r package gamlss was used to fit a log-normal model for Lapwing population abundance with grassland less than 5 years old as a covariate. The grassland &lt; 5 years old was statistically significant covariate (p&lt;0.0001), and the residuals of the model were approximately normally distributed as shown in Figure ??. ## GAMLSS-RS iteration 1: Global Deviance = 192.9757 ## GAMLSS-RS iteration 2: Global Deviance = 192.9757 ## ****************************************************************** ## Summary of the Quantile Residuals ## mean = 4.67573e-15 ## variance = 1.066667 ## coef. of skewness = -0.3010934 ## coef. of kurtosis = 2.375124 ## Filliben correlation coefficient = 0.9630635 ## ****************************************************************** 3.8.6 Spatial abundance distriution The abundance prediction created above is spatial and so can be plotted to show how species abundance is spatially distributed across Shetland.

This is shown in Figure 3.28. Figure 3.28: Change in breeding wader density (count/km2) It can be seen that the drop in abundance as shown in Table ?? is reflected in the net change plots.

If the results were in agreement across both analysis periods they are marked as strongly supported (SS) and if only in one period partially support (PS). If the hypothesis is not supported by the results at all, or it is not statistically significant, then it is marked as not supported (NS). Figure 4.1: Summary of support for hypotheses made in the introduction, for associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariates, between 2002 and 2019 inclusive 4.1 Improved grassland coverage (H1) In the 1980-90s agricultural subsidies encouraged the farming of high numbers of upland sheep (Shetland Islands Council 2016), which in turn supported the “improvement” of marginal in-by grassland so as to produce silage as a winter feed for sheep. Improved fields were also treated with lime and fertiliser so as to artificially boost yields of grass for silage. The practise of rotating re-seeded improved grassland and a spring-sown crop is not widely undertaken in Shetland any longer. The area of ground in cultivation for crops (excluding improved grassland) in Shetland fell by 90% between 1971 and 2008, with much of that decline happening pre 2001 (Shetland Islands Council 2016). This change in farming practices has meant that the grassland sward is typically permanent, and due to sheep grazing is therefore likely to be uniform in structure. The practise of annual fertilising and liming will increase pH which is good for invertebrate abundance, but fast growing and uniform sward, ready to cut in the early summer before the end of the wader nesting season, may not be ideal for breeding waders. The 2002-2010 analysis period for improved grassland is positively associated with Curlew and Redshank, and negatively associated with Snipe. The second analysis period from 2011-2019 has improved grassland positively associated with all wader species, apart from Snipe which is again negatively associated. The second analysis period validates the hypothesis that there is a positive association between breeding wader density and improved grassland, whilst the first analysis partially supports this. Snipe are known to breed in marshes and bogs (Robinson 2005) and the results agree with this, in that their density response is negatively associated with improved grassland in both analysis periods. For Lapwing and Oystercatcher, the population change ratio between 2002 and 2019 was positively associated with increased grassland coverage and this agrees with the literature (ref) in that both species prefer to nest in short (grazed) uniform sward in the spring. However Figure 3.28 clearly shows that between 2002 and 2019 Lapwing abundance has decreased significantly in the south mainland, where improved grassland is the dominant habitat. Current agricultural practices on the more intensively-managed improved grasslands may be incompatible with successful lapwing and Oystercatcher breeding. For example, fast growing silage grass may not provide the open view that lapwings require throughout their nesting period, which could lead to nest abandonment. This could be due to a reduction in sheep headage in turn reducing the need for improvement of grassland, between 2002 and 2019. The reduction in cropping and improved grassland together with lower natural food availability in the upland habitat of Shetland, could have driven a declining Oystercatcher and Lapwing populations to increasing densities in the remaining preferred improved grassland habitat. Mccallum et al observed this phenomenon in their paper (McCallum et al. 2018) - “Lapwing distribution is being constrained between intensively managed lowland farmland with favourable soil conditions and upland sites where lower management intensity favours Lapwings but edaphic conditions limit their distribution” 4.2 Topsoil organic carbon content (H2) Peat rich soils have an organic carbon content &gt;40% by weight. Figure 3.14 shows that this is the case for the majority of Shetland soils. A higher organic content is associated with greater soil acidity, which in turn means that a low earthworm abundance (McCallum et al. 2018). Both analysis periods from 2002 to 2019 have strong support for the hypothesis that topsoil organic carbon content is negatively associated with breeding wader abundance. The only exception is for Snipe during 2011-2019 where there was no statistically significant association. In terms of the population change ratio, Snipe population change is positively associated with an increase in topsoil organic carbon content, and Lapwing are not. This is consistent with the literature in that Snipe prefer wetlands which are likely to be acidic bogs that have high organic carbon content, and Lapwing prefer bare fields or short sward grassland that will have relatively low organic carbon content in the topsoil. 4.3 pH (H3) Soil pH, together with topsoil organic carbon content, is a key indicator of soil health (McCallum et al. 2016, 2018) as measured by earthworm density, which falls significantly if the soil pH is less than 5.5. As Shetland soils are mostly acidic peatland, especially in upland areas, a significant proportion of soils have a pH below this level (see Figure 3.14). It is therefore likely that peatland areas are negatively associated with earthworm abundance. Improved grassland is typically treated with lime and fertiliser in-order to boost growth and therefore this habitat typically has a high pH, giving it a positive association with breeding waders. The 2002-2010 analysis period for pH has no statistically significant associations with pH, apart from Snipe, which were positively associated. The 2011-2019 analysis period had positive associations for Curlew and Oystercatcher. So it seems that the second analysis period partially supports hypothesis H3, but the 2002-2011 analysis period does not. In terms of the population change ratio, pH is positively associated with Lapwing and Oystercatcher population change, and negatively associated with Snipe which is consistent with the literature. Snipe prefer wetlands that are likely to have significant rush vegetation which is typical for a relatively low pH soil. 4.4 Heathland percentage coverage (H4) Farmland in Shetland is currently neither highly intensive nor extensive, and primarily occurs as improved grassland and a very small proportion of barley for animal feed. (&gt; 95% of agricultural land). Wader feeding habitat such as improved grassland or shallow wetland is typically embedded within a mosaic of semi-natural blanket bog unimproved grassland and heath. Heathland habitat within 500m to 2500m (???) too wetland or improved grassland, makes it ideal for nesting waders such as Curlew, Redshank and Snipe as they can exploit the availability of earthworms and invertebrates too feed their chicks whilst nesting in longer heathland vegetation that gives their nest sites greater protection from predators. The 2002-2010 analysis period partially supports the hypothesis that heathland is positively associated with all wader species, with only Oystercatcher and Snipe having a positive association with increased heath percentage coverage. This is expected for Snipe, but Oystercatcher are primarily nest on improved or rough grassland. The second analysis period from 2011-2019 shows that all breeding waders have a positive association with increased heath coverage. This results together with the result of the population change ratio association for heathland percentage coverage, suggests that non-heathland species such as Lapwing and Redshank are being displaced from their preferred habitat of improved grassland and wetland respectively, due to changes in habitat between the two analysis periods. Anecdotal evidence suggests the condition of heathland habitats in Shetland since the late 1990s has improved, due to the disappearance of sheep headage payments that supported very high numbers of sheep in the hills and agri-environment scheme funding for removal of sheep from the hills. Greater vegetation cover and low disturbance levels during the breeding season is possibly providing more suitable nesting conditions in the second survey period. 4.5 Grassland percentage coverage (H5) Within the EUNIS landcover categorisation dataset, grassland contains improved and semi-natural grasslands and so is quite a broad class of habitat. It was expected to have a strong association with all breeding wader species due to the presence of both feeding (earthworms and other invertebrates) and nesting sites, and this is the case across both analysis periods. Perhaps more interesting is that Redshank are the only species to have a statistically significant association in the population change model for grassland association. Breeding Redshank population change is negatively associated with grassland percentage coverage. The reason for this could be that Redshank require a structurally diverse sward, with areas of tall vegetation to hide their nest, and patches of open vegetation and shallow pools for chicks to feed in (Sharps et al. 2016). The maintenance of such conditions relies on grazing practices that create a diverse sward, whilst avoiding nest trampling during the breeding season. From an agricultural point of view, suitable redshank habitats are often of poor value and if they have not been agriculturally improved with drainage, they may have become under-grazed leading to habitat which is not suitable for Redshank. Agri-environment schemes have supported the conservation of wetland and wet grassland, primarily through the exclusion of livestock during the breeding season with a light grazing period in the late summer and autumn to remove the annual growth of vegetation. However, if the weather and ground conditions are unsuitable at the end of the year for livestock grazing, these wetlands may be left ungrazed, creating a dense sward of low value as breeding habitat in the following spring. 4.6 Bog percentage coverage (H6) A significant amount of Shetland is covered in peatland. Healthy peat is relatively acidic due to its permanently water logged state, and so there is unlikely to be a sufficient earthworm supply to support breeding wader populations. The results suggest that this is the case with both analysis periods showing negative association between breeding wader abundance and bog percentage coverage, with the exception of Snipe where association was not statistically significant in the first analysis period. In terms of the population change ratio, it appears that Redshank are positively associated with increased bog percentage coverage. This could be because Redshank prefer a mosaic of wet habitat and grassland when breeding, or it could be that grassland has become less favourable in terms of food availability and so Redshank are nesting in bog habitat as the next best alternative. The population change ratio for Curlew is negatively associated with increased bog percentage landcoverage. This presumably is because nesting Curlew prefer tall vegetation typical of rough grassland and heath. 4.7 Elevation (H7) Habitat at higher elevations within Shetland is typically heathland, exposed rock or bog and heavily exposed to the extremes of a marine sub-arctic climate. As such food supply for breeding waders will be relatively low compared to lowland areas. This hypothesis is confirmed by the results, which show there is a strongly supported negative association between breeding wader abundance and elevation, except for Snipe, which was not statistically significant. The population change model for elevation has only statistically significant associations for Curlew and Redshank. The fact that breeding Curlew abundance is negatively associated with elevation could again be due to shorter nesting vegetation and availability of earthworms at higher elevations, which are typically peat bog or rock. Redshank population change is positively associated with bog and heath cover, and negatively associated with grassland cover. Whilst lowland habitats are less suitable, higher altitude habitats may have become more attractive. 4.8 Distance from the sea (H8) The results for the distance from the sea to the nest site vary by significantly by species. In the first analysis period Curlew, Oystercatcher and Snipe have positive associations for distance from the sea to nest locations, whilst Lapwing have a negative association and Redshank is not statistically significant. The second analysis period has the same results apart from Oystercatcher which now have a negative association. Those species that show greater nesting abundance at large distances from the coast may be responding to pressure from coastal predators. Shetland has a significant coastal population of Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra (JNCC 2020) and gulls such as the Great black backed gull Larus marinus that may predate wader eggs or chicks. For species that respond negatively to the distance from the sea, Lapwing and Oystercatcher, this may be because their preference is for improved grassland that is predominantly in the south mainland and typically only a few hundred meters from the sea. Snipe breeds in moorland habitats that may be further away from the coast. The only statistically significant results for the population change model are for Curlew and Oystercatcher, which both show a negative association between population change over the two analysis periods and distance from the sea. This maybe due to changes within inland nesting territories, such as the decline in available food resources over time. 4.9 Bare peat percentage coverage (H9) Shetland has a significant amount of degraded peatland, and a proportion of this is degraded to the point where the thin vegetative top layer of sphagna known as the acrotelm has completely died, leaving the deep acidic and water logged peat store known as the catotelm exposed. The exposed bare peat layer then further degrades overtime. The results for the two analysis periods show that as expected wader breeding abundance is either strongly or partially supported by a negative association with bare peat percentage landcover. This is most likely due to their being very little food resources available and suitable nesting opportunities in such habitat. Although the population change model results show that Redshank are positively associated with this covariate. This could be because bare peatland forms part of upland mosaics that include wetlands and heath, where Redshank are known to nest. 4.10 Available water capacity (H10) Heathland together with unimproved grassland and blanket bog characterises the majority of habitat within the Shetland archipelago. Breeding wader densities in these semi-natural mosaic are found to be consistently higher when surrounding landscapes had more wetland at scales ranging from 500 m to 2500 m, indicating the importance of wetland availability (Jóhannesdóttir et al. 2019). Both analysis periods show that all breeding wader abundance, apart from Snipe, is negatively associated with increasing water capacity of the topsoil. This is contrast to the hypothesis made in the introduction [ref] that postulated that wader abundance would increase as available water capacity increases. It appears that whilst all waders have a preference for damp or wet habitat, only Snipe tolerate water logged habitat that is characteristic of the upland semi-natural mosaic. Although it appears that the population change model shows that Oystercatcher and Redshank are also tending to show a positive association in terms of population change and available water capacity. 4.11 Landcover heterogeneity (H11) Marginal entropy is a metric to measure the thematic complexity, or heterogeneity of landcover. As postulated in (???) landscapes that have relatively low agricultural productivity and that are farmed at low intensity and extent often maximise species diversity and resources. As Shetland is characterised by this type of agriculture practices, which in turn are embedded within a semi-natural mosaic of wetland, heath, rough grassland and peat bogs, it is expected that wader breeding abundance is positively associated with marginal entropy. There appears to be strong support for this hypothesis across all wader species, except Snipe. Snipe are negatively associated with increasing marginal entropy and this is likely due to their preference (Farm Advisory Service 2017) for dense wetland and moorland habitat when nesting. This exists extensively in Shetland. 4.12 Landcover homogeneity (H12) Relative mutual information seeks to measure the degree of spatial aggregation of habitat classes within the wider landscape it is situated in. The hypothesis that waders would negatively respond to the same habitat at an increasing spatial scale, due to lower available food resources per unit, is not supported by the results. The results suggest a positive association between all wader species and relative mutual information in the first analysis period, an no statistically significant association apart from Snipe, that are positively associated, in the second analysis period. It is expected that Snipe would be positively associated with increasing relative mutual information as they are specialists of dense heathland habitats. Despite the non-conclusive evidence for the two individual analysis periods, the population change model does have statistically significant negative associations for increasing relative mutual information and Lapwing and Oystercatcher abundance changes. This suggests that both these species have shown lower nesting densities when habitat homogeneity increases. This result supports the assertion that Lapwing and Oystercatch prefer nesting habitat of short or bare grassland surrounded by shallow wet scrapes; that is landcover that shows significant heterogeneity. 4.13 Shetland wader population trends and implications for conservation outcomes The results from the Shetland wader population trends show that breeding waders across Shetland have declined, but not nearly as much as those on the UK mainland. The 2015 BTO Breeding Bird Survey (Harris, S.J., Massimino, D., Newson, S E., Eaton, M.A., Marchant, J.H., Balmer, D.E., Noble, D.G., Gillings, S., Procter, D. &amp; Pearce-Higgins, J.W. 2016) estimates that across Britain farmland wader breeding populations between 1995 and 2015 declined -19% for Oystercatcher, -43% for Lapwing, -48% for Curlew, -39% for Redshank. A 1993 RSPB wader survey [ref] was conducted inorder to estimate the overall numbers of breeding waders on lowland Shetland (a total area of 398 km\\(^2\\) ). In 1986 a survey was undertaken of Shetland moorland (ref), a total area of 1,019km\\(^2^\\). Although both surveys are separated by some nine years, the sum of both surveys gives an estimtate for the baseline for the results of this study. Table ?? shows the results of the combine 1986 and 1993 surveys, together with the population estimates for the BBS surveys in 2002 and 2019. Species 1986 1993 1986 + 1993 2002 2019 CU 1950 2025 3975 4567 4088 L 650 1950 2600 3474 2638 OC 1700 3300 5000 5269 4760 RK 110 1075 1275 2390 2248 SN 800 2650 3450 6043 7391 It can be see that for Curlew, Lapwing and Oystercatcher 2019 and 1986/1993 population estimates are broadly similar, but there was a noticeable increase in Redshank and Snipe. For Snipe it is possible that the methodology for estimating their numbers has improved, such tht the 1986/1993 survey underestimated their numbers. What about Redshank? Comparing 2019 too 2002 it does look as if there was a general decline in each species, apart from in Snipe. The most significant decline being Lapwing the analysis shown in Figure xxx shows that Lapwing decline are strongly associated with a reduction in reseeding of improved grassland for agricultural silage. The clear association between declines of lapwing and temporary grassland is statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) and it suggests that the 24% drop in the Shetland Lapwing population could be due to the significant decline of bare spring-sown grassland and tillage. This finding is also suggested as the major cause of Lapwing declines in a 25 year study of a population of farmland breeding waders (Bell and Calladine 2017). Lapwing appear to benefit from agricultural practices that create bare earth or a very short sward (&lt;5cm) every spring, as this in turn allows them and their chicks to feed on invertabrates, given their relatively short beaks. This evidence could help in shaping agri-environment schemes, where focus to-date focused has been on improving nesting habitats, rather than focusing on ensuring feeding habitats enhanced. Ideally a mosaic of both habitats would be created under these schemes. 4.14 The significance of soil health on wader populations An important area that has arisen through analysing wader densities and population change is the interaction between semi-natural and improved grassland habitats, and how this interaction drives food availability for wader chicks. Breeding wader research has recently started to focus on understanding the importance of soil health (McCallum et al. 2018, 2016) in creating adequate food supplies for breeding waders. Understanding earthworm and invertebrate density gradients in different habitat types, and any interaction effects between environmental covariates would be beneficial to improving wader populations and is a potential area of future work. There has been some related work (Pansu et al. 2015) whereby environmental-DNA of soil samples was sequenced to make landscape-scale assessments of soil-biodiversity and its drivers. As the population change model for Lapwing clearly shows (ref), their population whilst declining, has increased in density on declining lowland improved grassland. This suggests that lack of available feeding habitat could be driving this particular change in spatial distribution. One way of improving feeding habitat in areas where suitable lowland habitat is not available, could be through the application of lime on upland where there is a greater amount of suitable nesting habitats, but where food abundance is not sufficient due to the quality of the soil structure. 4.15 Covariates that were not explored Vegetation structure - tall dense vegetation containing rushes is not preferred by Lapwing or Oystercatcher, as they require vegetation that gives them a clear line of sight for predators. when nesting. However dense and taller vegetation structure is ideal for waders in general as Redshank, Curlew and Snipe can hide their nests in the longer grass and rushes. Recent work (Howison et al. 2018) has focused on developing radar‐based remote sensing technique (Sentinel‐1 C‐band radar) for large‐scale quantification of agricultural land‐use intensity and vegetation, across human‐dominated landscapes. Predation - there is significant potential for wader nest and chick predation on Shetland. Possible predators include hedgehogs, rats, corvids and coastal predators including otter and gulls. It was not possible to obtain relevant survey data in order to test this hypothesis and remains an important area of possible future survey work and data analysis. Weather - changes in weather patterns might also have a significant long term effect on breeding waders on Shetland. For example very wet spring weather may mean it is not posssible for grassland to be reseeded or spring crops, such as barley, to be sown. As discussed previously, this is a key habitat for Lapwing and Oystercatcher. An important piece of future of work wouldbe to examine the impact of future scenarios of climate change. If the wader breeding season has more survere weather, this may significantly affect wader food sources or productivity in general. 4.16 Conclusion "],
