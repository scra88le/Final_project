This nesting strategy means that the wader continuously surveils their environment for predators, immediately taking flight if an attacker enters the vicinity of the nest, and relying on the fact that eggs within the nest are cryptically marked so as to avoid detection. Groups of Oystercatcher and Lapwing can often form aerial displays in-order to ambush and deter any attackers [ref]. Most wader species exist near water and feed on invertebrates or small crustaceans by probing in mud and soil, or picking items off rocky shores in both coastal and freshwater habitats. This feeding behaviour is facilitated by the use of slender and often long bills that can be used for probing, together with relatively long legs to allow wading in shallow water when feeding. Euraisian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus - primarily lives at the coast, where it also breeds and feeds on bivalves and gastropods. Has over the last 50 years started to breed in-land on farmland, where it’s primary food source is earthworms and insect larvae. Oystercatcher have strong mate and site fidelity, where a single nesting attempt is made per breeding season. They typically lay their eggs in April and unlike other farmland waders, they will sometimes nest close to man made habitat such as buildings or on top of drystone walls. Nesting on flat gravel roofs was first noted in Aberdeen in the 1960s, with these birds often feeding in urban parks and on lawns. Unlike other waders, adults can take food to their young rather than requiring the young to move to areas where they can feed themselves; a feature which enables rooftop nesting. Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus - outside of the breeding season, they may overwinter in large flocks in-land as far south as northern Africa. Lapwing feed on insects and earthworms, and have a preference for feeding at night in order to avoid predators. As the Lapwing has a short bill, they can only forage for food near the surface of the soil. They will therefore typically nest in areas that are invertavrate rich. Lapwing often form loose colonies that can together to drive away predators. Their chicks typically hatch in early May, with replacement clutches typically in June if the first hatch failed. Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata - Scotland’s largest wader generally spend their winters near the coast and return to their breeding territories to hatch their chicks in early June. This later breeding period than Oystercatchers and Lapwings is associated with a requirement for the nest to be in vegetation (c.15cm tall or more). The Curlew can be migratory, often over wintering in Africa or Southern Europe. Though in the milder climate of Scotland it can be resident all year round. Common Redshank Tringa totanus - perhaps the least common of the farmland waders. They spend the winter at the coast, particularly on mudflats and estuaries and nest most abundantly on wetland, espeically coastal saltmarsh and machair. Pools of shallow standing water are particularly attractive to nesting Redshank, as they feed on the small invertebrates that they support. Their chicks hatch in late May. They are a migratory species, over wintering on Atlantic coasts south of Ireland and Great Britain. Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago - Snipe nest in dense cover of rushes and sedges within wetland habitats, as well as in wet scrapes and bogs in moorland habitats. They feed on invertabrates in areas of shallow standing water. They reside in farmland wetlands throughout the year. Snipe are often difficult to observe and often are only detectable by listening out for the drumming that results from their display flights. 1.2 Declines in wader populations Wader populations are declining across the world (Butchart et al. 2010), and farmland waders are one of the highest wildlife conservation priorities on Scottish farmland. A recent paper (Bell and Calladine 2017) reported results of a 25 year study (1990 to 2015) on a typical Scottish farm north of Stirling (a survey area of 7.5km\\(^2^\\). The authors explain how over this time Oystercatcher have declined by 95%, Lapwing by 88%, Curlew by 67% and Redshank by 87%, from peaks of 125, 365, 57 and 53 pairs, respectively. The UK Eurasian Curlew breeding population represents 28% of the total European population and 19% of the global population (Eaton et al. 2015). This significance of the population internationally, coupled with such a large drop in UK numbers has resulted in the species being added to the UK red list. In Ireland, a former stronghold for Curlew, there are thought to be only 150 breeding pairs remaining in the entire country; a decline of 96% since the early 1990s. It is now thought that Curlew will become extinct within Ireland by 2025 (O’Donoghue 2018). 1.3 Agricultural intensification drives wader declines In the (Bell and Calladine 2017) paper changes in spring sward height, considered to be due to changes in crop type, were associated with changes in the numbers of breeding waders over time. Interestingly, the productivity by a sample of Lapwings was unchanged through the study period, indicating that other factors such as predation or adverse weather did not contribute to declines. 1.4 The Shetland archipelago Shetland is a subarctic archipelago located in the North Atlantic between Scotland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The total area of the islands are some 1,466 km\\(^2\\) and they experience an oceanic temperate maritime climate.Due to the relatively harsh climate, short growing season and poor soil quality, Shetland has relatively low agricultural intensification when compared to the rest of the UK. The traditional crofting approach to farming has created farmland characterised by a mosaic of low intensity cropping and grazing. These factors have helped to create a hotspot for farmland breeding waders. The most recent estimates of the Shetland breeding population are from surveys carried out in the late 1990s: 2,300 pairs of Curlew, 1,740 pairs of Lapwing, 3,350 pairs of Oystercatcher, 1,170 pairs of Redshank and 3,450 pairs of Snipe (Harvey et al. 2004) 1.5 Breeding wader abundance response to habitat types To date there has been limited research into quantifying how the abundance of breeding waders respond to habitat differences. (Franks et al. 2017) looked at how environmental covariates affected breeding Curlew. Table ?? below summarises known habitat and sward height that the farmland waders discussed above, typically select for a nesting site. #waderPrefs Habitat Preferences for Breeding Waders. Wader Breeding habitat Sward height Breeding season Oystercatcher Grassland or arable fields Short April - July Lapwing Grassland, spring crops, fallow land Bare/short April - late July Curlew Heathland, grassland and bog Long May - late July Redshank Wet grassland, wet scrapes Long May - late July Snipe Wetland, standing water Long ? With regards to the categorisation of sward height: bare - ploughed land with no emergent vegetation. This is typical of spring sowed crops short - managed (improved) grassland for grazing, or for mowing to make hayage or silage. Sward is typically less than 5cm tall. long - unimproved grassland, fallow pasture, heathland, marsh or wetland. Sward is typically 15cm or more. 1.6 Breeding wader abundance response to landscape composition and scale The size and composition of a landscape is key to sustaining a long term population of a bird species, especially one that has experienced a recent decline (Macdonald 2019). If a suitable landscape exists at the necessary scale, it will provide security against localised adverse effects such as starvation, predation, inbreeding and bad weather. This in-turn will allow populations, whose number is above a certain threshold, to survive major short-term fluctuations, in abundance (Melbourne and Hastings 2008). Understanding how abundance of breeding waders respond to the scale and composition of suitable habitat could be a major factor in helping to conserve them. 1.7 Study objective and hypotheses The aim of this study is to use farmland wader abundance data within the annual Shetland Breeding Bird Survey, to investigate how breeding wader abundance responds to various environmental covariates at different scales. It is expected that this will provide additional information to inform conservation efforts on Shetland, as well as updating population trends for each of the study species. In meeting these objectives the hypotheses were formulated as outlined in Table ?? were tested. Here predictions on how the abundance per unit area (density) of breeding waders is associated with various covariates that either vary in scale (and are typically environmental) or composition. #waderHypo Hypothesis for associations of habitat scale and composition for breeding wader density. ID Hypothesis Wader Density H1 Farmland that is managed as improved grassland for silage or haylage has higher earthworm density (ref?) Positive H2 Earthworm density is negatively associated with high organic carbon content within the topsoil, due to increased soil acidity (McCallum et al. 2016). Negative H3 Earthworm density is positively associated with higher topsoil pH, as common earthworm species are acid intolerant (low pH) (McCallum et al. 2016) Positive H4 Heathland per unit area is a key habitat for breeding waders (why?) Positive H5 Grasslands per unit area is a key habitat for breeding waders (why?) Positive H6 Peat bogs per unit area, are not a key habitat for breeding waders Negative H7 Higher elevations are associated with lower earthworm availability Negative H8 Some wader species have evolved to feed on coastlines over winter, so nesting further from the coast reduces food availability Negative H9 Bare peat per unit area is not associated with earthworm availability Negative H10 Available water capacity within the soil is an indicator of the degree of wetness of the soil Positive H11 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F that shows thematic complexity indicates habitat heterogeneity, which is associated with higher availability of food Positive H12 Habitat with EUNIS classes D, E and F that show high spatially aggregation indicates habitat homogeneity, which is associated with higher availability of food Negative As waders have different sward height preference, there will be some variance in support for these hypotheses across species. Incorporating environmental covariates into a abundance response model will allow References "],

The remote islands of Foula and Fair Isle were removed from the study area. 2.2 Breeding wader survey data Two independent sets of survey data were used to provide spatial abundance for breeding waders. The Shetland Breeding Bird Survey (SBBS) is a citizen science project that is overseen by the Shetland Biological Records Centre. The SBBS is an annual survey undertaken since 2002, whereby local volunteers select a 1km Ordnance Survey 1km\\(^2\\) to survey. It is important to note that to encourage volunteer uptake, these squares are not randomly allocated in space; typically the location of the survey is selected by the volunteer. There are 3992 1km squares that cover the Shetland archipelago; excluding Fair Isle and Foula. Volunteers walk either a 2km transect around their chosen square, or two 1km transects that bisect the square. All breeding bird species observed 100m either side of the transect are recorded. All transects were walked twice, typically April to mid-May and mid-May to late June. All surveys were undertaken before 9am and in good weather (wind force four or less, and dry). The annual abundance recorded for each breeding species within a given square is the maximum of count from the two visits. Upto 2019 there have been 139 different OS 1km squares surveyed as part of the SBBS. Although the survey runs every year, not all 139 survey squares have been covered annually. Since 2002, new squares have been introduced over the years, some are no longer covered, and there are some gaps when volunteers have been unable to carry out surveys. The RSPB have undertaken annual field based surveys across a number of well-known Shetland breeding wader sites since 1987 (Campbell and Ellis 1987). The initial survey covered 33,000 ha or 293 sites of inbye land; this is land that is lowland rough grassland, and is typically not farmed intensively. From the 1987 survey, 6900 ha or 122 sites were identified. The survey data used in this study was recorded between 2013 and 2018 and are taken from up-to 29 sites, a subset of the original 1987 sites. The survey method (O’Brien and Murray 1998) required observers to walk to within 100m of every part of the survey site and to complete their survey between dawn and 12:00 hours. Three visits were made, one in each of the periods 15 April-30 April, 1 May-21 May and 22 May-18 June. Successive visits were separated by at least a week. Cold, wet or windy weather conditions were avoided. Each wader observed was recorded against a specific field. The method for calculating the breeding wader abundance recorded was species specific: Lapwing, Oystercatcher and Redshank abundance was recorded as the total numbers of birds seen in each field; Snipe—the number of drumming plus chipping birds in each field; for Curlew the mean count of individual Curlew (MNI) over three standard survey visits to each site was calculated, and the numbers of nesting pairs was calculated as 0.71 MNI + 0.10 (Grant et al. 2000). 2.3 Estimating detectability The two surveys in question assumed perfect detectability of the survey species. Due to the imprecise nature of field surveys this could result in a bias in species detectability, which could further result in inaccurate population estimates. To account for this bias, there are a number of sophisticated statistical techniques such as distance sampling that account for this, in order to reduce the standard error associated with a population estimate (Newson et al. 2008). Such techniques typically require more structured survey techniques such as precisely measuring the distance and angle, between the target and the transect line. Unfortunately this data was not available for the two survey datasets used within the study. Inorder to generate a probabiliy of detection, and therefore account for detectability bias, the r-package unmarked (Fiske and Chandler 2011) was used to generate a probability of detection for each species. Unmarked adopts a generative modelling process whereby observations are modelled through a combination of (1) a state process determining abundance at each site and (2) a detection process that yields observations conditional on the state process. Probability of detection (detectability) was modelled using unmarked for each species by using count data across multiple sites within and years, using day of year as a covariate. An average was then taken across years to give an average detectability for each species. 2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis An exploratory data analysis was undertaken on the SBBS dataset as per the protocol outlined in Zuur (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010). In addition survey locations were plotted spatially across each survey year in order to gauge survey effort. Outliers were removed etc etc 2.5 Environmental covariates Environmental covariates were generated with values spatially assigned to each Ordnance Survey (OS) grid cell, at 1km resolution. The grid reference was generated to match the SBBS survey data. The spatial extent of the covariate grid excluded the remote islands of Foula and Fair Isle in order to reduce computational time when fitting spatial abundance models. The following environmental covariates were quantified for the OS squares and periods studied: 2.5.1 EUNIS habitat classification The EUNIS habitat classification is a European wide system for habitat classification (“EUNIS” 2014). For the purposes of EUNIS, a ‘habitat’ is defined as: ‘a place where plants or animals normally live, characterized primarily by its physical features (topography, plant or animal physiognomy, soil characteristics, climate, water quality etc.) and secondarily by the species of plants and animals that live there’ Each habitat type is identified by specific codes and a description. The classification of terrestrial habitat is hierarchical and comprises three levels. For the purpose of this study the level 1 classification was used so as not to overdisperse the response variable (breeding wader abundnace). The EUNIS dataset is available as a categorical GeoTiff file, at a resolution of 10x10m. The level 1 EUNIS categorisation is shown in Table 2.1. Table 2.1: EUNIS habiat classificaiton L1 Classification Habitat Description A Marine habitats B Coastal habitats C Inland surface waters D Mires, bogs and fens E Grasslands and lands dominated by forbs, mosses or lichens F Heathland, scrub and tundra G Woodland, forest and other wooded land H Inland unvegetated or sparsely vegetated habitats I Regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats J Constructed, industrial and other artificial habitats K Montane habitats X Habitat complexes A raster file containing the EUNIS habitat classification for Scotland in 2019 was cropped to the extent of the Shetland archipelago, and the percentage coverage of habitat classes D, E and F were calculated for each OS square (n=3000?). Wader breeding sites are assumed to be predominantly within D, E and F habitats. 2.5.2 Improved grassland Across Shetland crofters have improved parcels of low-lying grassland in-order to take an annual crop of haylage or silage. It is typically used as fodder for sheep and cattle during the long winter season. This habitat is an important environmental covariate for studying breeding waders, as it has been suggested that improved grasslands are an important feeding habitat for nesting waders and their chicks (McCallum et al. 2018). Improved grassland is not a specific category within the EUNIS habitat classification, rather it is included within Grasslands class (E), which also covers unimproved and rough grasslands. Consequently remotely sensed satellite image data were used together with supervised machine learning techniques (Abdi 2020) to generate a spatial classification for Shetland improved grassland. A Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Shetland archipelago, comprising 11 different spectral bands (“Sentinel-2” 2020) , was used to produce an improved grassland raster layer. This was achieved by using the r programming language (R Core Team 2019) to train both a support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used in conjunction with the tidymodels package (Kuhn and Wickham 2020) to classify each raster cell, according to the spectral band values within it. Training datasets comprising polygons were created across five different habitat classes: improved grassland, unimproved grassland, upland, bare peat and crops. 1000 spatial samples were randomly drawn from each class training dataset; a sample comprising a value for each of the 11 spectral bands, for the specific sample location. The aggregate training dataset , comprising 5000 samples, was then split into training and testing data. The training data was subsequently resampled using 5-Fold cross-validation in order to reduce variability of the model classification. The hyperparameters of a radial basis SVM were tuned and the best model was selected based on an accuracy metric validated against the test data split. The model fit was then used to make a prediction for improved grassland over the entire Shetland archipelago. 2.5.3 Median topsoil pH content A shape file detailing the median topsoil pH content across Shetland was provided by the James Hutton Institute. A higher soil pH has been shown to be associated with greater earthworm abundance [McCallum2016-jt], which is one of the main food sources of breeding farmland waders and their chicks. The weighted median pH was calculated for each SBBS OS 1km square at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.4 Topsoil organic carbon content A shape file containing the topsoil organic carbon content was downloaded from the James Hutton Institue (Lilly, A and Baggaley, N and Donnelly, D. 2012). The topsoil of grasslands store significant amount of Carbon (Eze, Palmer, and Chapman 2018). Therefore fertile grasslands favoured by waders may have significant carbon stored within the topsoil, whilst grassland that is heavily grazed by livestock may have relatively low carbon storage.The mean topsoil organic carbon content was calculated for each SBBS OS 1km square at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.5 Available water capacity Available water capacity (AWC) is the amount of water a soil can provide for plants, and so is a useful indicator of the ability of soils to grow crops. The amount of moisture in the soil is thought to be an important aspect of wader abundance (Smart et al. 2006). A shape file detailing the AWC across Shetland was downloaded from the James Hutton Institute (Gagkas, Z., Lilly, A., Baggaley, N. &amp; Donnelly, D. 2019), and the mean AWC across each SBBS 1km square was calculated at a resolution of 10m x 10m, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.6 Bare peatland Shetland has a significant amount of degraded peatland, due to natural wind and water erosion, worsened by past land management practices such as overgrazing and damaging methods of peat cutting for use as fuel. It is expected that the resulting bare peat is negatively associated with breeding waders. Scottish Natural Heritage have produced a shapefile of bare peat, at a resolution of 10x10m (Blake 2020). The percentage cover of bare peat for each SBBS 1km square was calculated, using the spatial features package (Pebesma 2018) within r. 2.5.7 Distance to sea Proximity of breeding wader territory to the coast as in-land breeding sites could be more sheltered from Shetland’s maritime weather. For each SBBS 1km square the mean distance to the coast was calculated using a raster for the Shetland landmass. 2.5.8 Elevation the r package elevatr (Hollister and Tarak Shah 2017) was used to generate a mean elevation above sea level for each SBBS 1km square. 2.6 Bootstrap analysis of SBBS survey squares As SBBS survey volunteers were able to choose which squares to survey, they are not randomly allocated. As such this may not be a true representation of the distribution of habitat types across Shetland. In order to analyse any potential bias in the habitat types surveyed, a bootstrap analysis was performed across all OS 1km squares, using the EUNIS habitat categorisation. This was then compared against a bootstrap of surveyed 1km squares from a single SBBS survey year (2018). This provides a quantification of how biased survey samples are with respect to the overall Shetland landmass. 2.7 Wader food response 2.8 Breeding wader density response to environmental covariates To investigate how breeding wader abundance responds to environmental covariates a generalised additive model (GAM) was used. The approach is an extension of work undertaken to look at breeding Curlew density undertaken by the BTO (Franks et al. 2017). Species count data from the SBBS was split into two time periods, each covering nine years; 2002-10 and 2011-19. Then for each species and each surveyed square within the two time periods, a mean count was derived for each of the two time periods and joined with the respective environmental covariates, as a function of spatial location. Breeding wader counts were modelled using a log link function with a poisson distribution in R using the gam function in the mgcv package (Wood 2003). Location coordinates of survey squares were converted to planar OSGB36 national Grid coordinates as normalized easting and northing (in meters). Spatial variability in wader abundance was modelled as a spatial smooth, with the number of knots constrained (k = 20) and environmental covariates included as a parametric term. A different gam was generated for each environmental covariate, in order to explore univariate associations between response and covariate. To explore absolute abundance of breeding wader species per 1km\\(^2\\) the natural log of the average detectability per species was included as an offset within each gam model. The gam structure is summarised in equation (2.1). \\[\\begin{equation} log(E(Y)) = s(easting, northing, k=20) + \\beta _1 X_{i1} + log(Z_i) + \\epsilon _i \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] , where X is the environmental covariate, Y is species count per surveyed square, Z is average species detectability. Associations between response and the spatial effect of environmental covariate were determined by the resulting p value of the gam fit. Only those models with p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Plots of density (abundance per 1km\\(^2\\)) against each environmental covariate were generated in order to visualise the trend of any association between response and covariate. 2.9 Breeding wader population change as a response to environmental covariates Given models for breeding wader density response against environmental covariates across two distinct time ranges, a new set of models were created to model the change in abundance between 2002-10 and 2011-19 by using the count in 2011-19 as the response, and the natural log of the 2002-10 count as an offset. It is assumed that detectability remained constant within each \\(1km^2\\) square, which in turn means that changes in count reflect changes in density, against a given environmental covariate. Only SBBS squares that were surveyed in both periods and where breeding waders were present in 2002-10 where used, as it is not possible to take the natural log of zero. the population change ration was then plotted against each environmental covariate, in order to determine the nature of any popultion decline (or increase) as a function of the given environmental covariate. 2.10 Habitat spatial complexity response In order to investigate an association between breeding wader abundance and the complexity of habitat spatial patterns within the landscape, metrics using information theory (IT) (Nowosad and Stepinski 2019) were applied to quantify habitat pattern complexity of all SBBS squares across Shetland. Results from each metric were then incorporated into gam density response and population change models as covariates, in order to explore if varying degrees of habitat spatial pattern are statistically correlated with breeding wader abundance. The r package landscapemetrics (Hesselbarth et al. 2019) was used to generate all IT metrics, using the EUNIS habitat raster for Shetland as a spatially distributed categorisation of landscape habitat. A description of the different metrics incorporated in the analysis is as follows: Marginal Entropy, H(X) - measures the compositional diversity of habitats in space; from mono-thematic patterns (lower H(X)) to multi-thematic patterns (large (H(X)). So landscapes with one dominating habitat (for example, peatland on the Shetland island of Yell) have a relatively low H(X), whilst landscapes with multiple different types of habitat that are evenly distributed (such as a village with a patch work of gardens, housing and undeveloped land) have a relatively high H(X). This can be seen in Figure 2.1, with H(X) shown above each landscape sample. Figure 2.1: Marginal Entropy Conditional Entropy, H(Y|X) - quantifies the geometric intricacy of a spatial pattern within a landscape. If habitat type A is predominantly adjacent to habitat type B, H(Y|X) will be relatively low. Conversely if habitat type A is adjacent to many different habitat categories, then H(Y|X) will be relatively high. Figure 2.2 gives some examples of this. Figure 2.2: Conditional Entropy Joint Entropy, H(X,Y) - this provides a measure of the uncertainty in determining the habitat category of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. So landscapes with high H(X,Y) are typically spatially complex with many different habitat types. Note that joint entropy is not capable of distinguishing between patterns that have high spatial aggregation. The variation can be seen in Figure 2.3 . Figure 2.3: Joint Entropy Relative mutual information, U - quantifies the degree of aggregation (clumpliness) of spatial habitat categories from fragmented patterns (lower U) to consolidated patterns (higher U). A landscape comprising a loch within a forest would have a relatively high U, whilst a landscape comprising many different crop types spread across many small fields would have low U. Figure 2.4 gives a mutual entropy landscape Figure 2.4: Relative Mututal Entropy 2.11 Wader population abundance modelling Given the set of environmental covariates for each SBBS 1km\\(^2\\) square and the associated SBBS count data, a machine learning approach using rand the tidymodels (Kuhn and Wickham 2020) package was taken to fit a regression model. The resulting model enabled an annual population to be generated for each breeding wader species across all of Shetland, from the 2002 to 2019, as a function of environmental covariates. In order to fit the model the count data for each species were adjusted according to their mean detectability. All count data for a given SBBS 1km square was joined with the associated environmental covariate data. The joined data were thens plit such that 70% was allocated to model training and 30% to model testing. The training data were then processed so that covariates that have 80% absolute correlations with other covariates are removed; this ensures that possible adverse outcomes due to co-linearity are minimised (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010). The covariate data within the training dataset were then normalised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. An extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) algorithm was used to fit a regression model using a poisson distribution. 10-fold cross validation was used to resample the data in order to ensure any bias in SBBS survey squares was minimised. Hyperparameters used to fit the xgboost model were selected using a grid containing 20 random variations for each hyperparameter: min_n - the minimum number of data points in a node that are required for the node to be split further) trees - the number of trees contained in the ensemble mtry - the number of predictors (covariates) that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree models. A model was fit for each hyperparameter combination and for each species; giving 200 different models. The best model fit for each each species was selected according to the lowest root mean squared error (rmse). The hyperparamters associated with each best fit were then used to further tune the model for a final fit. The rmse for the final fit was then evaluated against the test dataset, for each species. Finally, to generate an annual population account across all over Shetland for each species, the final model fit was used across all SBBS 1km squares (n=?). This gave a mean estimate for abundance for each square, plus a lower and upper confidence interval. Summing up these values across all squares, for each species by year, gave an overall population estimate across Shetland for the years 2002 to 2019. 2.12 Wader spatial distribution modelling Having generated an abundance prediction for each SBBS square, the spatial abundance can be plotted using the spatial coordinates for each SBBS square. Spatial distributions were plotted for 2002 and 2019 in order to visualise spatial abundance distribution between the two periods, for each species. The net change between the two periods was also plotted so as to visualise the areas of Shetland that have seen a net increase or decrease in species abundance between 2002 and 2019. References "],

It seems that there has been ongoing surveying effort in the south and central mainland and on the islands of Unst, Bressay and Noss, but less coverage elsewhere. Figure 3.1: Number of years a SBBS 1km square was survyered (n) between 2002 and 2019 3.1.2 Outliers The Cleveland dot plot (Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick 2010) is a chart in which the row number of an observation is plotted versus the observation variable, thereby providing a more detailed view of individual observations than a boxplot. Points that stick out on the right-hand side, or on the left-hand side, are observed values that are considerably larger, or smaller, than the majority of the observations. Figure 3.2 appears to show that there are no major outliers across all species, but that there are many counts equal to zero indicating that the data might be zero-inflated. Figure 3.2: Cleveland dot plot of species counts in Shetland BBS data from 2002 to 2018 3.1.3 Testing for normality A large number of statistical regression techniques assume normality. Visualising the SBBS count data as a histogram can help assess if it is normally distributed. This is shown in the plot in Figure 3.3.

Species W p-value OC 0.8628058 0 L 0.7546102 0 CU 0.8327195 0 RK 0.6995970 0 SN 0.8000661 0 The p-value for each species in ?? is &lt;&lt; 0.05. This suggests that the count data for all species are significantly different from the normal distribution. 3.1.4 Poisson distribution and zero inflation The histograms of species counts in Figure 3.3 suggest that count data is poisson distribution. Also there are a significant number of zeros in the count data, for all species. This suggests that the zero-inflation poisson distribution describes the data. Table ?? below shows the results of a significance test (Broek 1995) for zero inflation in a poisson distribution. Species Expected zeros Zeros observed Chi squared p-value CU 223.9173 433 384.2445 0 L 323.5230 585 547.5071 0 OC 119.1142 309 446.9641 0 RK 520.3458 694 271.6801 0 SN 134.4406 359 577.9990 0 All results have a significant statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) and therefore the count distribution across species is assumed to be a zero-inflated poisson process. The statistical modelling methods used on the data must support a poisson distribution and zero inflation where possible. 3.1.5 Homogeniety of variance Homogeneity of variance within the data is an important assumption in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other regression-related models. The series of boxplots in Figure 3.4 show how counts across all surveyed BBS squares vary across years 2002 to 2018, for each breeding wader species. Figure 3.4: Box plot showing variance of counts across all surveyed Shetland BBS squares and all years, by species To test the homogeneity of variance of species counts between years, for each species, we can apply the Fligner-Killeen test. This is used as the count data are shown to be non-normal. Table 3.1 shows the results of the test applied to the Shetland BBS data. For p-values &gt; 0.05 the data variance are homogeneous. Table 3.1: Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variance for Shetland SBBS species counts, across all years Species Chi-squared p-value df OC 18.11614 0.3171401 16 L 29.11514 0.0231712 16 CU 18.36325 0.3030590 16 RK 26.72879 0.0445979 16 SN 47.40824 0.0000588 16 Lapwing, Redshank and Snipe variances are heterogeneous according to the test results in Table 3.1. The solution to heterogeneity of variance is to transform the response variable to stabilize the variance year-on-year, or applying statistical regression techniques that do not require homogeneity. 3.1.6 Status of surveys between 2002 and 2019 Before any detailed statistical modelling was undertaken a simple analysis into how the population changed in each surveyed 1km square between 2002-2011 and 2012-2019. The 1 km squares shown (n=139) were those surveyed in both periods and where farmland waders colonized, increased, remained stable, declined or went extinct. This gave an initial view as to potential population trends between the two stated periods. Figure 3.5 shows the state changes between the two analysis periods. Figure 3.5: Population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 Figure 3.6 below shows an aggregation of certain categories; whereby extinct and decreased are grouped, and colonised and increased are grouped. Figure 3.6: Aggregate population status change per Shetland BBS square - between 2002-10 and 2011-19 3.1.7 Survey Bootstrap Shetland BBS volunteers were able to choose which squares they surveyed. The survey squares are therefore not randomly allocated across the Shetland archipelago. As a result of this non-randomised allocation there could be potential bias in the habitat types surveyed; for example, in-bye is closer to roads and housing than upland habitats. To test this a bootstrap of percentage cover of EUNIS habitat categories D, E and F (see 2.1) across all OS 1km squares was undertaken, and then compared to a bootstrap of the same data, but only those OS squares surveyed by volunteers as part of the Shetland BBS. Figure 3.7: Mean % cover per 1km\\(^2\\) of EUNIS habitat types D, E and F, bootstrap sample of OSGB squares v boostrap of surveyed squares. R=1000 This shows that grassland and heathland are significantly oversampled within the Shetland BBS surveys. 3.2 Detectability The r package unmarked was used to generate an estimate for the probability of detection, or detectability. Table ?? shows the average detectability across all survey years, for each species. Species Detectability OC 0.803 L 0.723 RK 0.667 CU 0.831 SN 0.723 3.3 Improved grassland classification The results below detail how remotely sensed satellite data was processed using a Support Vector Machine to generate a classification for improved grassland across the various islands of Shetland. 3.3.1 Shetland Sentinel 2 satelitte dataset A Sentinel 2 satellite spatial dataset was clipped using the Integrated Administration And Control System (IACS) field boundary shapefile for Shetland. This gave a spatial dataset comprising of land-based habitat only, excluding built areas and roads, as shown in Figure 3.8 Figure 3.8: Clipped Sentinel 2 RGB composite of Shetland 3.3.2 Sentinel 2 spectral bands used in habitat classification The Sentinel dataset is represented as a layered set of images (a raster) known as a RasterBrick (Hijmans 2020). Each raster layer is a spatial representation of one of 11 different spectral sensor readings. The sensors used within the Shetland sentinel dataset are shown in Table ??.

A number of areas representative of each habitat type were selected as can be seen in Figure 3.9. ## Reading layer `Training_samples&#39; from data source `/Users/anthony/Documents/GitHub/shetlandwaders/data/training_data_classification/Training_samples.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 161 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 415800.5 ymin: 1108793 xmax: 466132.7 ymax: 1217616 ## CRS: EPSG:27700 Figure 3.9: Habitat classification training areas 3.3.4 Sampling of habitat training classes Each habitat training dataset was randomly sampled in order to train a support vector machine classifier. Distributions for the sampled data for each training set are shown in Figure 3.10. The NIR and red vegetation spectra appear to be the most distinct across different habitat types. Figure 3.10: Sampled distributions for each training class, from the Sentinel 2 dataset of the Shetland landmass 3.3.5 Support vector machine classifier training The SVM was trained to classify the five target habitat classes so that improved grassland can be separated and used as a covariate in wader response modelling. 3.3.6 Search grid parameterisation The SVM parameters used to create a number of different models are shown in Table ??.

The results of classifier accruracy are shown in Table ??. Metric Estimate accuracy 0.8534091 kap 0.8240900 The confusion matrix in Figure 3.12 shows the results of the model prediction for each habitat class against thsoe of the test data set. The most incorrectly classified habitat is improved grassland versus crop, followed by Upland versus Bare Peatland. Both of these inaccuracies are not significant to the objective of producing an overall classification for improved grassland, in that crop habitat is often reseeded impproved grassland. Figure 3.12: Confusion Matrix from classificaton of test dataset 3.3.9 Classification across all Shetland habitat The best fit model was then used across the raster dataset for all of Shetland, to enable classification of all habitat. The results are shown in 3.13. The improved grassland and crop habitat is predominantly in the south of the island. It can be seen that the main middle island, Yell, is predominantly upland and bare peat. Figure 3.13: Classification of Shetland habitat in order to determine the location of improved grassland 3.4 Environmental covariate analysis Each of the covariates described in {#environmental-covariates} was generated for each Shetland BBS squares (n=3992). 3.4.1 Histogram of environmental covariates Figure 3.14 shows histograms of for these covariates for data taken across all Shetland OS GB 1km squares. It can be seen that bog type habitat predominates across Shetland, and that majority of the landscape is at less than 100m elevation. The mode for the pH is around 4, which is typical for acidic peatland. Figure 3.14: Histograms of environmental covariates across all of Shetland 3.4.2 Histogram of environmental covariates for Shetland BBS squares only This can be contrasted with covariate histograms for only those OS squares (n=139) that were surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS, as seen in Figure 3.15. It seems across all nesting wader species, there is a preference for wet but not water-logged habitat as seen in the AWC histogram. Also, the majority of breeding waders appear to nest within 1km of the coast. It appears that breeding waders also have a preference for grassland (both improved and unimproved) presents the majority of the habitat cover, over heathland. Figure 3.15: Histograms of environmental covariates across only those squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS 3.4.3 Density plots Density plots of all environmental covariates across Shetland BBS squares (n=139) are shown in Figure 3.16. These figures provide an overlay to the histogramsin {#histogram-of-environmental-covariates-for-shetland-bbs-squares-only}, and represent a smoothed version of a histogram to show the probability density function of the variable. Some distributions are highly skewed, such as distance to sea and elevation. Whilst other covariates like topsoil organic carbon and bog cover are largely a uniformly distributed. None of the covariates appear to be normally distributed. Figure 3.16: Density plots of environmental covariates against breeding wader count data 3.5 Environmental covariate response GAMs for breeding wader abundance response across the five different species were generated from 2002–10 and 2011-19. They included 10 environmental predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 3.5.1 Environmental covariate GAM model parameters Table ?? shows the GAM model parameters for the model fits for the two periods where abundance response (density) was modelled, and the associated plots showing breeding wader density against each environmental covariate are shown in Figure ??. The statistically significant correlations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate are summarised for each species in heatmaps; Figure 3.17 for 2002-10 and Figure 3.18 for 2011-2019. Figure 3.17: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2010 inclusive For the 2002-10 survey period in Figure 3.17, it can be seen that pH is only statistically significant for one species (Snipe), whilst topsoil organic carbon and grassland are oppositely correlated. Distance to sea is perhaps the most interesting covariate in that Lapwing show greater density at the coast whilst Curlew, Oystercatcher and Snipe show greater densities inland. Figure 3.18: Summary of associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2011 and 2019 inclusive In Figure 3.18 we can see that there are fewer associations that are not statistically significant. For Curlew it is seen that all covariate associations are now statistically significant (versus 2002-2010 where pH and Heathland cover were not significant). Oystercatcher also have all covariates with statistically significant associations, but for the later survey period the distance to association is now negative with increase distance. Lapwing only have one covariate, pH, that is not statistically significant. For Redshank the main change in the later survey period is that Heathland percentage cover is now statistically significant, and has a positive association. Snipe now have a positive association with available water capacity and a negative association with percentage bog cover.

Figure 3.29: Summary of population change ratio associations between breeding wader density and environmental covariate, between 2002 and 2019 inclusive Figure 3.29 suggests that the environmental covariates with that have had the most positive associations with breeding wader density are heathland percentage cover and available water capacity, whilst the percentage of bare peatland has had no statistical significance, followed by the percentage grassland cover that has only one negative association with the population change ratio of Redshank. The model parameters and associated plots for population change ratio modelling are shown in Figures ?? and Table ?? respectively.

They included 5 IT predictor variables (covariates), and the model parameters for all species across the two response periods can be seen in Table ??. A third model was generated by taking the abundance response from the first two models to generate the ratio of population change between the two response periods. 3.7.1 Histograms of Information theory covariates Histograms of IT covariates using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, across all of Shetland are shown in figure 3.35. The marginal entropy for the Shetland landscape is approximately normally distributed, indicating that habitat within the Shetland landscape is spatially diverse but that very low and highly diverse habitat within Shetland are relatively rare. The mode of the conditional entropy is relatively low with a distribution that shows significant positive skew; this suggests that the Shetland landscape has relatively low geometric intricacy. This arises when cells of one category within a landscape raster are predominantly adjacent to cells of the same category. The overall spatio-thematic complexity is measured by joint entropy. This can be thought of as quantifying the uncertainty in determining the habitat type of a focus cell and an adjacent cell. For Shetland, joint entropy appears to be approximately normally distributed. This indicates that habitat with very high or low spatio-thematic complexity is relatively rare on Shetland. Due to the spatial autocorrelation, the value of mutual information tends to grow with a diversity of the landscape (marginal entropy). To adjust this tendency, it is possible to calculate relative mutual information by dividing the mutual information by the marginal entropy. Relative mutual information always has a range between 0 and 1, and quantifies the degree of aggregation of spatial habitat. It can be seen that for Shetland, relative mutual information is distributed with significant negative skew. This implies that habitat types across Shetland are predominantly aggregated - small relatively information values indicate significant fragmentation in landscape habitat patterns. Figure 3.35: Histograms of Information Theory covariates across all Shetland OS 1km squares 3.7.2 Histograms of Information Theory covariates for surveyed squares only 1km squares surveyed as part of the Shetland BBS were used to generate IT covariates histograms using the EUNIS landscape categorisation, as shown in Figure 3.36. Here we can see that the conditional entropy and the marginal entropy across all surveyed squares had a mode that was significantly higher than the Shetland wide values shown in Figure 3.35. There is also significantly less negative negative skew in the relative mutual information of the surveyed squares.

It can be seen that the model fit for Snipe has the largest RMSE and Redshank, the lowest. For each species the minimum rmse given by the best model fit, together with the associated hyper parameters (trees= 1000 for all models) is shown in Table ??.

For Lapwing, pH, heathland percentage coverage and topsoil organic carbon content are the most important variables. Whilst for Oystercatcher, grassland and heathland percentage cover are almost equivalent in their importance followed by longitude. For Redshank and Snipe, available water capacity and heathland are the most important covariates in predicting abundance. 3.8.4 Generate population estimate over time The random forest regression model was used to predict species abundance over all (n=3992) Shetland BBS 1km squares. The model gave a mean estimate together with lower and upper confidence intervals (5% and 95% percentiles respectively), across every year the survey was run (2002 to 2019).

The most significant decline was breeding Lapwing abundance. Note that the confidence intervals for Snipe are highly variable in certain years. Table ?? shows the change in breeding wader abundance by species between 2002 and 2019. Species 2002 2019 % Change CU 4597 4088 -11.1 L 3474 2638 -24.1 OC 5269 4760 -9.7 RK 2390 2248 -5.9 SN 6043 7391 22.3 3.8.5 Spatial abundance distriution The abundance prediction created above is spatial and so can be plotted to show how species abundance is spatially distributed across Shetland. Figure 3.60 shows abundance distribution for each species in 2019. Figure 3.60: Spatial abundance distribution of breeding waders for 2002 and 2019 3.8.6 Net abundance change by species between 2002 and 2019 Given the spatial abundance distribution for 2002 and 2019, it is possible to plot the net change in breeding wader abudnance between the two years. This is shown in Figure 3.61. Figure 3.61: Change in breeding wader density (count/km2) It can be seen that the drop in abundance as shown in Table ?? is reflected in the net change plots. Significant increases for Snipe, but significant Lapwing density declines in the south mainland, and Oystercatcher across Unst and Fetlar. References "],
